This file is in four-part just harmony without any compromises in either the melodic intervals or the harmonic purity, yet moving rapidly through extensive harmonic territory in 5-limit JI to end on a pitch that is essentially the same as the beginning pitch (+2 cents or 1 schisma). 

The harmonic path was deliberately designed to accomplish this, taking advantage of the near equivalence of a JI diesis and two syntonic commas. The melody in the soprano moves from Ab to G# and then repeats. In JI, G# is 41 cents lower than Ab. However, this progression migrates the pitch upward by two syntonic commas (2 X 21.5 cents = 43 cents), so the G# actually ends up two cents higher than the Ab. Even when the same note is repeated with a slight gap or “breath” before restarting the sequence, this is barely detectable even to the most highly trained ears. You might find it fun to check that out for your own ear.

This was conceived as an exercise for four-part a cappella ensembles that would demand no compromises, either melodic or harmonic, in the purity of the intervals, yet rather than being harmonically static would cover extensive harmonic territory.

The realization of this as a midi file was implemented by my good and generous friend, John deLaubenfels who worked with me by email during several days of exchanges to get everything right (in spite of some niggling little oversights on my part).  

Hope you enjoy it!
