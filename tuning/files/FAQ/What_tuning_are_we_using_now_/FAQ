                   FAQ " What tuning System are we using now.                   *You, the musician or composer are probably using a tuning system known as                    Twelve Tone Equal Temperament, abbreviated as 12-tet. But if you come from a                    part of the world that not been changed musically by western culture then it                    is likely that you will be using one, or some of the other myriad of                    possibilities that exist.*                   "My musical training is just the standard western type one.                   "I can understand the twelve tones, but what does equal refer to ?                   Also what is temperament ? ...They never mentioned this in music class."                   *Your teachers probably didn't know what tuning system they were using                   either !                   Ok. Imagine an infinite continuum of pitch. From very low to very high. You                    could select pitches for your musical instruments from anywhere along this                    pitch continuum [P.C from now on]. You also could select any amount of tones                    from this P.C. Now which tones would you select ?*                   "I don't know... I suppose I would pick out the ones that sounded the                   best."                   *Yes so would I. So lets do that. I'm going to take two sound sources                   playing harmonic timbres, I'll explain what a harmonic timbre is in a moment                    but for the time being some examples of harmonic timbres are trumpets                    [brass], the bowed and plucked string family, woodwinds and the human voice.                   All these timbres are quite musical. Do you agree ?*                   "Yes."                   *Good ! Now I'll take, say, two trombones playing a unison [same tone or                    note] and then tell Trombone 1 to hold that note.  I'll then instruct                    Trombone 2, to slowly gliss up through the P.C.                   When you hear a note that you like say  "Hold it!"                   Ok,  let's begin. Trombone 2 do your thing !*                   [Trombone 1 slides up the P.C, maintaining a constant volume. It reaches a                   subminor third [7/6]]                   "Hold it !" [Trombone holds the note at the indicated pitch]                   *Ok, so why did you choose this interval ?*                   "Before this point It sounded rough and made a sort or warbling tremolo                    sound. Like an opera singer ! And then the warbling slowed down until it                    became all smooth and there was no longer any tremolo."                   *What you heard are called beats. Now I'll explain harmonic timbres to you.                    Trombone 2 is playing a tone now. I can sing that pitch. [He does so. And                    sings a unison with the trombone.] But that is not the only tone it is                    playing.                   There are additional fainter tones [also called overtones, partials or                   harmonics] at higher pitches that blend in with the fundamental pitch                    [tonic].                   Like when a string quartet plays a chord starting and ending together. It                    all sounds like one instrument.                   Well the other tones in the trombone are like that but they                   are very simple instruments and they all sound the same.                   If they played on their own they would sound very boring. These instruments                    are called sine tones or sine waves. The pitches of these sine waves follow                    a certain numerical relationship: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7 ... and                    so on. The numbers are called the harmonic series.*                   "What do the numbers mean ?"                   *They denote a relationship, a ratio if you will between two periodic                   vibrations.*                   "What is a periodic vibration ?"                   *Well it's when the air that sound travels in, compresses and expands in a                    consistent pattern for a certain length of time.                   Periodic vibrations that create these variations in pressure, more times in                    a given unit of time are heard as higher in pitch than those for whom the                    frequency of vibration is less per unit of time.                   In my previous example the number 1:1 is the same as the two trombones                    playing in unison. In the next one i.e. 1:2. It is like Trombone 2 playing                    an octave above Trombone 1. The periodic vibration of Trombone 2 completes                    twice as many cycles [vibrations] as Trombone 1 in the same amount of time.                   So we have looked at the pitch of tones a bit, but what happens when we add                    two simple or sine waves together ?                   Well, if we begin the sounds at the same time all that will happen is that                    the combined sound will be louder [amplitude].                   But what happens if we start one sound at a different time ?                   This is called the phase of the sound.                   When two waves are out of phase [i.e. they do not begin at the same time]                    the volume will be affected. Sometimes one wave will want to compress air                    molecules and the other will want to do the opposite causing a reduction in                    volume.                   Phase is measured in degrees just like a circle. Two waves at 0 degrees                    phase will be in phase, at 180 degrees the wave is completely out of phase.                   If the waves have identical amplitudes then there will be silence at 180                    degrees.                   The opposing forces have cancelled themselves out ! Any other phase between                    0 and 180 degrees will at times increase the amplitude of the overall wave                    and at other times diminish the volume. At 360 degrees the wave is in phase                    but one cycle displaced. Anywhere between 360 and 180 degrees is the same as                    before, i.e. alternating increasing and diminishing amplitude.                   Beats are very similar to sounds of the same pitch that are out of phase.                   For instance if you get two waves where the partials do not coincide exactly                    the difference in frequency will cause beats to occur at that difference of                    frequency.                   Just like in the previous example at times the two waves support                   each other and at other times they act like they are out of phase. There is                    a reduction in volume. To tune notes to those places where no beats are                    detectable is called just Intonation (JI), those places where there are no                    beats between harmonic timbres are expressible as small whole number ratios.                   There is still much to learn in this area and some composers and theorists                    welcome a broader definition of JI. One that would include all tunings                    expressible as whole number ratios. This is in line with a realization that                    psycho-acoustic investigation is in its infancy and has so far mostly dealt                    with dyads [two notes at once].                   Investigations into chords with harmonic timbres show ratios based on higher                    primes can be heard as consonant in the context of chords that follow the                    harmonic series.                   Anyway let's continue our experiment. Trombone 2 continue to Gliss...                   [They continue up the P.C, stopping whenever they hear an interval that is                    consonant. Soon they have ten notes that were selected for their special                    properties. In the order that they were found they are 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3,                    7:5, 3:2, 8:5, 5:3, 7:4 & 2:1].                   OK what interval of those did you find the most consonant?*                   "Well the fifth sounded the most pleasing I guess. And the major third was                    very sweet too."                   *It is subjective, within certain physical parameters...but most people                    agree with you and find the 3:2. fifth the most stable. Now let's make a 12                    tone scale by tuning 12 of these consonant 3:2 fifths on top of each other.                    Exactly like the standard circle of fifths you may be familiar with.                   To help us I have an electronic instrument that is capable of producing any                    desired frequency.*                   [The instrument looks like a standard keyboard with a tuning knob above each                    key.] The student tunes 12 pure fifths starting from C:                   C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - G# - D# - A# - F - C'.                   This tone is slightly over seven octaves above the initial C. He presses a                    button and the pitch automatically gets lowered by exactly six octaves.]                   *OK now tune the next available digital to a pure octave above the initial                    C.*                   [The student tweaks the knob until it a sounds a pure octave [2:1] above the                    starting C. This octave is on the key that would normally correspond to C#                    in normal western nomenclature]                   [The student sounds the octave] "There ! I don't think I could get a more                    consonant interval than that."                   *Yes, that definitely sounds like a pure octave to me. Ok now play the note                    that you have on the C' digital. Remember this is the note that was tuned                    after we took 12 pure fifths starting on the C digital an octave below.                    Compare this note to the one that you have just tuned to the octave.*                   [The student plays the keys together and finds that they do not sound a                    unison as he had thought they would.]                   "Hey ! These two tones are different.[He tries them in succession.] The note                    I tuned from the circle of fifths is sharper than the one I tuned an octave                    above the starting pitch. What gives ! "                   *Well your circle of fifths is really a spiral of fifths. That is, if you                    tune your fifths so that they are pure i.e. beatless no matter how many                    fifths you tune they will never match up to an octave of your starting tone.                    12 perfect fifths will always exceed 7 octaves [3^12:2^12 > 2^7:1^7 ].                   "But I do it all the time on my electronic keyboard at home !"                   *Yes that is right. I have your keyboard here today. It is tuned to the                    system of Twelve Tone Equal Temperament that I mentioned at the beginning of                    your lesson. I can now explain to you exactly what 12-tet means.                   O.K compare one of those perfect beatless fifths with one of the fifths on                    your keyboard.                   [The student tries both as instructed and repeats it a few times listening                    for the difference [if any]. He plays the notes in succession and                    simultaneously.]                   "I well the fifths on my keyboard sound a little bit rougher when sounded                    together, I don't think I can hear the difference when I play the fifths                    melodically."                   *I told you before that 12 just fifths exceed 7 octaves a little bit.                   The difference between 12 just fifths and 7 octaves is an interval called                    the  Pythagorean comma. This interval has a frequency ratio of                    531441:524288. About 23.5 cents.*                   "Cents ? What does money have to do with it ?!"                   *Oh ! I apologize. Cents are a method of measuring how big intervals are.                    They are based on the 12-tet tuning system that almost everyone in the                    western world uses. For comparison an octave is 1200 cents and each semitone                    is 100 cents.*                   "So this Pythagorean comma is pretty small. Less that an 8th tone ?"                   *Yes that's right. Also you may have guessed that you would need quite a lot                    of                   pitches if you were to keep all the fifths just. Taking 13 3:2's [fifths]                    from your starting tone leads you into a new note that is close to the first                    3:2 that you tuned from the original tone.                   Also any 3:2's tuned from these tones will lead you into more notes very                    close to notes we already have. That is assuming octave equivalency.                   "What is octave equivalency ?"                   *Well it is like when you sing a C and then you sing a C" two octaves up. It                    is perceptually the same note. It is still a C despite having a frequency                    four times that of your original C.*                   "Oh I C !: )"                   *A spiral of just fifths or any just interval can generate an infinity of                    pitches. After spiraling around for a while you will find that after                    travelling a certain distance with an interval there will be certain points                    that come close to octaves of your original for instance 12 fifths, 29                    fifths, 41 fifths, 53 fifths etc come close to octaves of your original                    tone.                   The tuning system we use...*                   "...this 12tet thing right ?"                   *Yes. 12tet takes 1/12 of the Pythagorean comma and takes this amount from                    each of the 12 fifths. Consequently in 12tet each fifth is exactly 700                    cents. In comparison a just fifth is 701.955 cents. All the intervals in                    12tet in some combination fit into an octave. This is not true of just                    intervals*                   "What a great idea !"                   *Well it is a fairly good idea for the music that existed at the time when                    12tet was suggested. 12tet was known about since 350 BC. In the renaissance                    era when                   Marin Mersenne tabulated the correct proportions of 12tet the primary                   consonances were fourths, fifths and octaves. These are the intervals that                    stay most in tune in 12tet. The 12tet fourth is 500 cents which is very                    close to the just fourth at 498.045 cents. And of course the octave is just.                    This was a medieval inheritance from the ancient Greek Pythagoras. His                    school considered the octave, fifth and fourth to be the only perfect                    consonances. Renaissance theorists though began realizing that thirds and                    sixths were also consonant.                   These weren't the Pythagorean major and minor thirds with the                   dissonant proportions of 81/64 and 32/27 respectively but were based on the                    prime number 5.                     This is the fifth harmonic and created the proportions of 5/4 and 6/5                    [major and minor]. Presumably the general population had been using such                    intervals in harmonic singing all along.                     It was only the medieval church musicians and theorists who clung to the                    idea that the numbers 2 and 3 could generate all the necessary musical                    resources.                   12tet perfectly matched the Pythagorean musical thinking of the Middle Ages.                    But from the renaissance onwards the 12tet that was being increasingly                    adopted was forced into playing [esp. keyboard] music that treated thirds                    and sixths as stable consonances.*                   "Does 12tet approximate 5/4 and 5/3 etc. well ?"                   *No not at all. 5/4 is 386.314 cents while the 12tet major third is 400.00                    cents. The just major sixth: 5/3 is 884.359 cents compared to the 12tet                    version which is 900 cents. When you did your listening experiment earlier                    today you found the following intervals consonant 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 7:5,                    3:2, 8:5, 5:3, 7:4 2:1.                   From this lot 12tet only approximates 3:2 and 4:3 well. It obviously                    represents 2:1 exactly because this is the interval that has been carved up                    into 12 equal divisions.*                   "I guess that those other intervals are not that important ?        The                    music I hear on the radio-blues, rock and pop all use 12tet. It all sounds                    pretty good to me."                   *That's not true. Those other intervals, and many more, are very important.                    For one the flattened thirds, tritones and minor sevenths beloved of blues                    have been shown to correspond to the just intervals 7:6, 7:5 and 7:4                    respectively.                   A vocalist can sing any tone he likes and so can many skilled saxophonists,                    guitarists and other instrumentalists capable of expressive intonation. The                    problems rests mainly with keyboard instruments and the lack of awareness of                    alternatives to 12tet. Once you realize that probably much of your favorite                    music uses intervals outside of the 12tet domain you can start to explore                    your tonal resources in a more informed way. Once you start to tune to                    different systems you just might get addicted.
