Quick review of how you add an entry:

Upload file to Files area.

Check file name has no spaces in it.

Add entry to database.

For first field of the entry, give the folder name
_As shown in the tree itself_

Second entry is the short descr, third is the url to
the file you have just uploaded, then it's your name, 
and answer Yes, okay to convert to ascii (for a text file)

.........................................

If you need a new second or higher level folder to put
it in, add a new  field to the database

parent folder | child folder

and leave the url blank for that one.

Then add your entry as before, using the new child folder as
the first field.
