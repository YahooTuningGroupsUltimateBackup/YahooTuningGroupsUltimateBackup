this is just a preliminary note about the 'poor boy 
generalized keyboard' system i've managed to 
put together. many factors such as my ankle 
re-injury earlier this year, as well as a custom 
guitar project for jeff g. and the rankinization 
of the fingerboard on a long neck banjo for 
siem t. has left me short of time and energy to 
write a planned article. 

briefly, FTS, or robert walker's program 'Fractal Tune Smithy', 
enables one to turn a computer keyboard into a microtonal 
music keyboard. 

at some point i decided that a desktop computer was taking 
up too much precious space in the studio and the fan 
would make just enough background noise to interupt my 
train of thought during a pause while practicing/composing. 
i turned to the internet and started hunting down legacy 
laptops. 

of course, this also involved a bit of effort getting some parts, 
as well spending a bit of time reconditioning the system and 
installing software. in the picture, you'll see, what was 
$30,000 worth of computers barely FIVE years ago, which 
have gone into my $300 'poor boy generalized keyboard'.... 
a 99% savings for living off a society that appears to be 
addicted to the latest and most expensive toys !!!!!!!!!!
