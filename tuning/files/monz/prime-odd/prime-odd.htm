I've made MIDI-files of the three chords Paul discusses here:

<A HREF="5l-maj7.mid">
8:10:12:15</A>, the 'classic' 5-prime-limit 15-odd-limit 'major 7th' tetrad

<A HREF="15o-13p.mid">
9:11:13:15</A>, a 13-prime-limit 15-odd-limit tetrad

<A HREF="dis5ltri.mid">
400:512:625</A>, Paul's highly dissonant 5-prime-limit example triad





Here's a triangular lattice diagram of Paul's dissonant
5-limit triad:


              25:16
               /
              /
            ()
            /
           /
         1:1
         /
        /
      ()
      /
     /
  32:25


All tones in this chord lie along the 5-axis.  The voicing
1/1 : 32/25 : 25/16 gives the proportions 400 : 512 : 625.
The '8ve'-equivalent prime-factorization of this is
n^0 : 5^-2 : 5^2, or as Graham Breed would write it,
|0 0| |0 -2| |0 2| (the first number is the exponent of 3,
which is always 0 in this case).



I submit that the accordance (relative concordance or
discordance) of a chord is at least partially dependant
on a combination of both the prime- and the exponent-limits
exhibited by the prime-factoring of the ratios of the
perceived intervals in the chord.

(I say 'perceived intervals' to cover the cases where
the tuning is irrational; my opinion is that the ear/brain
system attempts to 'rationalize' musical sounds as much
as it can.)


I'm not arguing that odd-limit has no place in the theory;
but I think more fruitful results would come out of a
combined analysis of the prime-plus-exponent values.


I propose this in my definition of 'sonance', but I
suppose this requires revision, now that we've decided
conclusively that sonance is context-dependant.  So
the new entry for 'accordance' should have the contents
of the 'sonance' definition.

Joe, look carefully at the small lattice on that webpage for
this discordant 5-limit triad.

What I've been saying is, according to me, the prime- *AND*
exponent-limits are both important in evaluating accordance
of tri-/higher-ads.



I'll draw another lattice for the first chord.

In the nice, smooth 8:10:12:15 tetrad, '8' is the fundamental,
'10' is the 'major 3rd', '12' is the '5th', and '15' is the
'major 7th'.  Here's the lattice:

     10 ---- 15
    /  \    /
   /    \  /
  8 ---- 12


10 and 12 are both only one 'step' away from the fundamental 8,
on the 5- and 3-axes respectively.  Furthermore, these three
proportions reduce to 4:5:6, the strongest tonal concordance
possible with a tetrad of three distinct identities.  15 is
2 steps away from the fundamental; you can get there by either
of two 'routes': 8 - 10 - 15 or 8 - 12 - 15.  In either case,
all relationships are concordant, thus reinforcing the 4:5:6
concordance still further.  As Paul pointed out, the only
discordant interval in this chord is the 8:15 between the
'major 7th' and the 'root'.



In the much more discordant 9:11:13:15 tetrad, the perceived
(i.e., reinforced) fundamental is missing from the chord, and
we have 9 (== 3^2) and 15 (= 3*5) both 2 steps away from it,
and 11 and 13 both one step away from it.  I would say that
this produces greater discordance.

Something else producing greater discordance in this chord,
already pointed out by both Paul and myself, is the higher
prime-limit.  This means that the periodicity between chord-
members is lower: the largest interval, 9:15, reduces to
3:5, which is a dyad with pretty high periodicity.  But
the waveforms of the pitches in the dyads involving 11 and
13 have much further to travel before they come back in phase.

But note that while this chord is more discordant than the one
above, it's still not too 'bad' to my ears, and certainly much
more concordant than the following triad.  This is probably
because the odd-limit (= 15) is still rather low, and the
integers in the proportion are not much different from the
ones in the first chord.

I'd make a lattice, but it would be difficult following the
triangular formula I used for the 5-limit ones, because of the
number of different prime-axes (i.e., dimensions) involved.
If I had used my own lattice formula, I would have drawn all
three according to that.  



Now look again at the lattice of the dissonant triad.
I'll reproduce it here with the proportions instead of
the ratios:

              625
               /
              /
            ()
            /
           /
         400
         /
        /
      ()
      /
     /
  512


It is indeed a 5-limit triad, as can be seen plainly here.
There are several factors which I'd say make it a highly
discordant chord.

First, there are 2 or 4 steps along the 5-axis between all notes
in the chord, with *none* of the notes only one step away from
any other.  In this sense, it is much more discordant than
either of the two previous chords.

Second - very closely related to the first point - to use numbers
that give *integer* proportions between all chord-members (which
is what causes the perception of an otonal fundamental) the
numbers have to be quite high, which gives a bad score in the
low-integer game.  It's obvious from comparing the proportions
of all three chords that in this sense this one is *far* more
discordant than the other two.

Third, the perceived otonal fundamental (= 512) *is* present in
the chord but is *not* the note functioning as the 'chord root'
(= 400); this creates another kind of 'dissonance' (that between
perceived fundamental and functional chord-root) which I would
say adds further to the discordance.



I might postulate my theory as one based on 'close-packing':
the closer the lattice-points are to the fundamental, the
more concordant the chord.  In my lattice formula, higher
primes have longer spaces between steps along their axes
and lower primes have shorter spaces, so 9 (at the second
step on the 3-axis) is still closer to 1/1 than 11 (at the
first step on the 11-axis), and is thus more concordant.  

This property does not agree with my perceptions or Paul Erlich's
in 100% of the cases, so my formula still needs fine-tuning
(pun intended); but so far I find it more-or-less workable.


Does that make my theory clearer?  And remember, I could be
wrong - these are just my perceptions and speculations.
