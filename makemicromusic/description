Making Microtonal Music, a forum dedicated to composers, performers, and listeners of microtonal music. Microtonality explores tuning systems that are different from the 12-tone to the octave equal temperament that has dominated Western music for the last 150 years. This forum welcomes participation from all interested parties at any level of exploration.
