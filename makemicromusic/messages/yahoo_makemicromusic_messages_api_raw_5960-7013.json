Very cool, and very funky, indeed. \n&gt; Jealousy, BTW, can be used as an incentive to improve oneself :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, like Paul, this reminds me a theoretical question that I have\n&gt; been thinking about a while ago. \n&gt; I saw on your website that you like to use asymmetrical time\n&gt; signatures, too - so I would like to ask whether you ever tried to\n&gt; make music in 5-TET tuning and uncommon time signatures - especially\n&gt; multiples of 5? And if yes, did you notice something special - that\n&gt; certain time signatures are &quot;easier&quot; to compose than others, \ndepending\n&gt; on tuning? \n&gt; I have posted this question a while back in tuning-math (in\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/4616). The\n&gt; theoretical founding is not very solid - but maybe you can tell\n&gt; something from your own experience?\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Hans Straub\n\n\n***I think there is very little correlation between pitch and meter, \nunless one chooses to implement, specifically, a system that caters \nto this (say total serialization of all the parameters...)  This is \none reason that composers have varied so in their strengths in either \ndirection.  Take Schoenberg, for instance... he developed a very \nsophisticated notion of pitch and pitch manipulation and, yet, his \nrhythmic structures are, basically, the old traditional &quot;classical&quot; \nforms...  On the other end, composers such as Steve Reich and Philip \nGlass have fairly primitive pitch palettes and complex rhythmic \nstructures.\n\nA composer such as Brian Ferneyhough tries to have complexity in \n*both* the pitch and rhythmic realm, and some players seem to feel \nthis is &quot;overkill...&quot;\n\nSo, the question remains whether increasing complexity in *both* \npitch and metric realms is really a desirable attribute or not..\n\nAlso look at Partch... complex pitch, pretty simple rhythms.\n\nMaybe at least *one* of these &quot;perception vectors&quot; has to be relaxed \na bit in order for us to appreciate the other...

The passing thought just occured to me: perhaps the \nmore &#39;inharmonic \n&gt; scales&#39; and &#39;otonal and utonal and CPSes&#39; are easier to improv and \nand simple \n&gt; algorithmicpov in than are the harmonic, extended meantone-types \n(19,31,etc), \n&gt; which by their nature, demand a precise compositional treatment of \nharmonic \n&gt; resources, or a sophisticated algorithm that would take them into \naccount? \n&gt; Either way, it seems that one can pay less concern to pitch in the \ninharmonic \n&gt; ones, etc., and contruct music more abstractly and more focussed on \nrhythm, \n&gt; etc. There is a certain attraction for me in this, but I love both \nparadigms. \n&gt; I am not making a value judgement here.\n&gt; \n\n***This is an interesting P.S. thought :) and probably it seems true \non the overall.  However, such algorithmic spinning out of CPSs, for \nexample, I&#39;ve found less than enthralling (and I&#39;ve heard people do \nthis...).\n\nPersonally, I&#39;ve found that working with hexanys, for example, \ninvolves a *lot* of conscious compositional thinking and hearing, if \nthe music is going to be &quot;interesting...&quot;  I admit &quot;interest&quot; is a \nsubjective judgement but *I* know it when I hear it, and I&#39;m willing \nto believe that others do as well... :)\n\nbest,\n\nJ.

I&#39;d like to get a bit of synergy, and maybe make a co=\r\nuple \nof tweaks that would make it easier for people to be a bit more produ=\r\nctive, \neven if (and maybe especially) the results are small explorations, =\r\ntrial \nballoons, etc. Everything we do needn&#39;t be the final, polished diamo=\r\nnd.\n\nBut ruminating on Spring and recent discussions, I&#39;ve thought about th=\r\ne \nyin/yang of simplicity/complexity, and how frequently in tuning circles =\r\n\nHarmony is the ultimate goal, as opposed to other uses of tunings. We all =\r\n\nare attracted to differing muses, and will do what seems most compelling t=\r\no \neach of us. But I found the following text in an article on Kyle Gann&#39;s =\r\n\nexcellent blog, &quot;PostClassic&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/\n\nT=\r\nhe quote:\n\n&quot;Of all the despicable follies of modern music, the most despica=\r\nble is the \ndevaluation of simplicity. Simplicity has always been an artist=\r\nic virtue, \nand it remains one still - not an essential virtue, for there i=\r\ns too much \nenjoyable complex music to believe that. But other things being=\r\n equal, one \nremembers simple music far better than complex music, and I co=\r\nme back to \nthe simple pieces that have impressed me far more consistently =\r\nthan I do \nthe complex ones. Beethoven=92s sketches reveal that his first i=\r\ndeas were \nrarely simple and rarely good, and that in revising them he inva=\r\nriably \nsimplified them and made them infinitely more powerful in so doing.=\r\n To get \nyour music to where it is simple, and therefore memorable, and the=\r\nrefore \npowerful, takes tremendous effort, and many composers lie about tha=\r\nt fact \nbecause they don&#39;t want to put forth the effort.&quot;\n\nI&#39;m sure that th=\r\nere are people that won&#39;t agree with that, but I do. I can \ncertainly remem=\r\nber plenty of time(s) erasing tracks, simplifying parts, \ncutting it down t=\r\no the core essence.\n\nI&#39;m going to try simple for a while. I&#39;ll start with o=\r\nne musical match and \nsee what burns...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Some of the *worst* passages in my *own* music are some of \nthe most &quot;complicated&quot; sections.

(I wish I knew if \nthat was a NY-ism, or just a TV-ism as attributed to NY) I&#39;ve personally \nenjoyed Kyle&#39;s perspective on music, put forward with formidable chops both \nin compositional expertise and literary acumen; I&#39;d recommend his book \n&quot;American Music in the Twentieth Century&quot; (at amazon.com = \nhttp://tinyurl.com/2emob )\n\nAs for &quot;under-explored worthy corners&quot;, I just finished watching &quot;Lost in \nTranslation&quot;, and was struck by one moment in the scoring (the film is done \nwith all pop music - and I won&#39;t insult anyone by trying to nail it any \nmore than pop-electronic styles). At one point Charlotte goes to a park, \nwhere she comes upon and wedding procession, and continues walking, ending \nin a place where slips of paper (prayers? wishes?) are tied on branches. \nAll through this scene is a deceptively simple &#39;song&#39;, but while it isn&#39;t \nmicrotonal, there is a very, very definite fuzz added to the sound by the \nfact that most of the synth stuff is out of tune.\n\nBy that, I mean that it sound like the good old days of drifting \noscillators on analog equipment, and it becomes a sonic analog (if you \nwill) for the soft focus of some of the shots in the scene. It isn&#39;t \nsomeone purposely playing in 59tet, but it renders such a differing mood \nthat the &#39;tuning&#39; becomes an important part of the sound field.\n\nFWIW.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Only last week I fought off yet another attempt to make \ntheory and history central, and to relegate the performance and \ncomposition faculty to basically adjunct status. Institutions \nendemically tend toward a gradual shift from art to theory. It&#39;s \ndifficult to pinpoint how this happens, though not hard to find \nexcuses for. Art is a demanding mistress, and artists have little \ntime for organization (or continual e-mail postings). Organization of \nhierarchies and structures requires the same kind of analytical mind \nthat theorists must have by definition, and they take to it like \nducks to water. Theory and history can always prove themselves with \narguments and facts, and always seem so respectable; artists can \nnever prove what they&#39;re doing, and are always so vulnerable. The \ngreat stone walls of theory always get built eventually, and the \ntender seedlings of art get trampled underfoot in the process. And as \nstone walls multiply, the wilderness of the mind that art both needs \nand represents gets pushed further away from the city.\n\nAnd so, when the great composers who taught in academia in the &#39;70s \n(like Johnston, Martirano, Feldman) retired, the status-conscious \ndepartments of the &#39;80s replaced them with theorists. _Perspectives \nof New Music_ was begun by composers, Ben Boretz and J.K. Randall, \nand for the last several years has been edited by a consortium of \ntheorists. Of course, one notices that when the theorists came, the \nMidwestern university music departments died as hotbeds of \nexperimental musical activity. _Perspectives_ ceased to be an \nexciting journal of new ideas when the theorists took over. Not that \nI have anything against theory (hell, I&#39;m the only member of the \nmusic faculty who carries a pocket calculator, and even *uses* it in \nclass), but without the unpredictable, irrational spark of \ncreativity, theory tends to lie there on the table like the patient \nthat didn&#39;t pull through. On the other other side, artists need \ntheory, too - though, in my view, not very much of it, just a dash \nhere and there to push their work forward, not enough to straitjacket \nit.\n\nIf the tuning list had split into just intonation versus various \nequal temperaments, I would have thought, &quot;Well, that seems \nunnecessary, but not harmful: each of those areas of inquiry can \ncontinue independently of the other.&quot; But a split between theory and \npractical creativity doesn&#39;t strike me as so innocent - especially \nbecause it suggests that the tuning list is subject to the same \nforces that operate in academia and other inherently conservative \ninstitutions. If we here, of all places, can&#39;t understand that theory \nand creativity are an interconnected yin and yang, needing each other \nto remain lively, who on the planet will? For god&#39;s sake, how can \nartistic creativity keep any meaningful foothold in society when it \ncan&#39;t even keep a foothold in the *tuning list*?\n\nJust a thought. I&#39;m too much of a southerner to play Abraham Lincoln. \nI&#39;ll secede with MMM, and I already find more of interest over t/here \nthan I have on the tuning list in recent months. But perhaps that in \nitself shows how much the tuning list has to lose. I&#39;m afraid, in \nshort, that at MMM I won&#39;t find the occasional glimpses of bizarre \ntheory that fire my imagination - and that the tuning list, without \nart-talk, will become impenetrable.\n\nCheers,\n\nKyle Gann\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"

Glad to see you here...\n\n&gt; I must add, though, and to both lists, that I am a\n&gt; little disappointed to be casually told that the &quot;practical&quot; side of\n&gt; tuning has moved over t/here now, as though that were a predictable\n&gt; and perfectly unobjectionable development with no ramifications.\n\nI&#39;ve looked upon the split as not so much one between theory and practice  \nas between (A) a nasty name-calling environment full of endless pointless  \ntheorizing with a dash of occasional pointers to musical examples, and (B)  \nan environment of people who just wanted to share the non-12 music they&#39;re  \nactually working on, with a dash of methods & tunings.\n\nThe tuning list already was, for me, mostly impenetrable and largely  \nirrelevant numerology. I only stuck around there because it was the &quot;only  \ngame in town&quot; for microtonal people. Here, at least, people post pointers  \nto music and talk about methods (rather than endless spews of lattices &  \nratios). I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s *nothing* of interest there, just largely  \nof no interest to me, even if many of the people are good people. (E.g., I  \nmiss Margo.)\n\nI&#39;m confident that there&#39;s enough cross-membership that anything of real  \nimportance will eventually make it over here. And I poke my head in over  \nthere via the web interface once in a blue moon to see if anything&#39;s new...\n\n\tRick\n\n"

If we here, of all places, can&#39;t understand that \ntheory \n&gt; and creativity are an interconnected yin and yang, needing each \nother \n&gt; to remain lively, who on the planet will? For god&#39;s sake, how can \n&gt; artistic creativity keep any meaningful foothold in society when it \n&gt; can&#39;t even keep a foothold in the *tuning list*?\n\nI don&#39;t know, Kyle. I sympathize with you strongly about this yin and \nyang, and never saw it any other way.\n\nThere was never a single suggestion that practical creativity was off-\ntopic on the tuning list. There was never a complaint on the tuning \nlist that someone there was posting too much about practice and not \nenough about theory. What happened, I think, was that some theorists \nwere overly zealous in their desire to *explain* theory to people who \ndidn&#39;t want to think about it, to *discuss* theory with people who \ndidn&#39;t really want to go deeper than mere numerology, and to *apply* \ntheory to this or that idea when the originator of the idea would \nhave been happier had it gone unanalyzed. However, not one of the \noverly zealous theorists, nor anyone else on the tuning list, ever \nexplicitly discouraged, meant to discourage, or wanted to discourage, \nany amount of posting on practical matters, sharing of music, etc. It \nmight have been more of the &quot;walls&quot; effect you were mentioning. As a \nprofessional musician in many genres, I know it well, but \nunfortunately it&#39;s a lot more apparent when you&#39;re the victim than \nwhen you&#39;re the unintentional perpetrator.\n\nMeanwhile, before the creation of the MakeMicroMusic list, two theory \nthreads had already been willfully driven off the tuning list -- one \nled to the creation of the harmonic entropy list, and the other led \nto the creation of the tuning-math list. As I recall, the \nMakeMicroMusic list was one of two resurrections of the short-lived \nPractical Microtonality list. The initial formation of the PM list \ncame a surprise to many of us because there was never any indication \nthat anyone on the tuning list wouldn&#39;t have welcomed *more* posting \non practical matters, sharing of music, etc. And in fact the latter \nhave always been and continue to be part and parcel of the tuning \nlist, though not always in the proportion everyone would have liked.\n\nThere are a lot of myths about what the tuning list was like in \nthe &quot;good old days&quot;. It&#39;s easy enough to see for yourself -- go to\n\nhttp://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/ftp/tuning/list/archive/\n\nand pick a folder at random. This is ancient history, before I even \njoined. Note the McLaren posts and how they&#39;re often the most \nmathematical of them all.\n\n\n"

Is it remotely possible for you to see it in this light?\n\n&gt;However, not one of the overly zealous theorists, nor anyone else on the \n&gt;tuning list, ever explicitly discouraged, meant to discourage, or wanted \n&gt;to discourage,\n&gt;any amount of posting on practical matters, sharing of music, etc.\n\nI believe Rick put it fairly well: many people simply didn&#39;t want to sit \nthrough thousands of words on theoretical matters. If anything, it may have \npartly been a by-product of theory-spew! :)\n\n&gt;I know it well, but unfortunately it&#39;s a lot more apparent when you&#39;re the \n&gt;victim than when you&#39;re the unintentional perpetrator.\n\nWell, there you go.

I truly believe that, \nwith advances in the understanding of the physics of sound, the tools we \nhave at our disposal, and the unbelievably broad palette of what we can \ncall &#39;music&#39;, this world - tuning - is very much large enough to support \ndiffering interest groups *without* it being a priori a negative or \ncombative or competitive situation.\n\nI still read tuning. I continue to urge people to go their for the kind of \ninformation they will find there.\n\n&gt;The initial formation of the PM list came a surprise to many of us because \n&gt;there was never any indication that anyone on the tuning list wouldn&#39;t \n&gt;have welcomed *more* posting on practical matters, sharing of music, etc.\n\nIf anyone is interested, they might investigate how and what surprises them.\n\n&gt;And in fact the latter have always been and continue to be part and parcel \n&gt;of the tuning list, though not always in the proportion everyone would \n&gt;have liked.\n\nLike infinitesimal. That&#39;s life.\n\nIt can all work. These are just multiple parts of a journey.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Is it remotely possible for you to see it in this light?\n\nJon.\n\nI said &quot;overly zealous&quot;, which indicates that I was *criticizing* \nthese actions, not defending them.\n\nYou are incorrect that I couched at least two of these in \nsuperiority. I suppose you&#39;ll have to take my word for it as a fellow \nhuman being -- is it remotely possible that I am one? ;)\n\nThinking about theory is not superior to not thinking about it, and I \ndidn&#39;t intend to imply that it was. Those who didn&#39;t want to think \nabout theory had every right not to think about theory, and were in \nno way inferior to those who did.\n\nAnalyzing is not superior to leaving unanalyzed. I didn&#39;t mean to \nimply that it was. The creative mind, it&#39;s often said (with good \nreason), is stymied by analysis, unless the analysis occurs very far \naway from the creativity.\n\nBut yes, I do believe that in some cases, when one is intentionally \nusing numbers in the first place to shape one&#39;s tuning materials, as \nfor example in JI or temperament, quantitative reasoning can be more \nuseful than unreasoned numerical manipulation. I also believe that \nquantitative considerations that make contact with the realities of \nhow we hear can be more useful than those that derive from other \nsources. Those skilled and knowledgeable in these areas feel a \ncompulsion to share their knowledge and reasoning so as to benefit, \nand further the endeavors of, others. The goal is to help along, in \nany way they can, the creation of microtonal music.\n\nOften this works fine -- sometimes, brilliantly. But often, the \nresult is negative. There are various reasons for this. And this \ncan&#39;t helped by the usually dry tone of those doing the offering. \n\nNevertheless, I respect and have always respected anyone&#39;s right to \nuse &quot;mere&quot; numerology for musical ends -- I have no problem with \nthat. Once this intention is made clear, I don&#39;t bother this person \nwith quantitative reasoning or psychoacoustical touchstones anymore, \nbecause I know these won&#39;t be matters of interest.\n\nIs it remotely possible for me to see why someone would perceive the \nabove as being &quot;couched in superiority&quot;? Yes, it is. But after all \nthe time you and I have spend working through these things, I had \nhoped that someone wouldn&#39;t be you.\n\nI accept full responsibility, though. In my daily &quot;real-world&quot; life I \nreceive continual, unexpected praise for me ability to make everyone \nfeel comfortable and to relate to each of them on their own terms. \nThe evidence is overwhelming, at this point, that this skill often \ndoes not translate onto the internet. Something about the written \nword vs. a combination of speech and body language, I suppose.\n\n&gt; &gt;However, not one of the overly zealous theorists, nor anyone else \non the \n&gt; &gt;tuning list, ever explicitly discouraged, meant to discourage, or \nwanted \n&gt; &gt;to discourage,\n&gt; &gt;any amount of posting on practical matters, sharing of music, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe Rick put it fairly well: many people simply didn&#39;t want \nto sit \n&gt; through thousands of words on theoretical matters.\n\nI wish Rick had put it &quot;remotely&quot; that well. But yes.\n\n&gt; &gt;I know it well, but unfortunately it&#39;s a lot more apparent when \nyou&#39;re the \n&gt; &gt;victim than when you&#39;re the unintentional perpetrator.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, there you go. I wish more people could realize that, and open \ntheir \n&gt; sensitivities to this perspective. On both sides...\n\nSo do I.\n\n&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, before the creation of the MakeMicroMusic list, two \ntheory \n&gt; &gt;threads had already been willfully driven off the tuning list -- \none led \n&gt; &gt;to the creation of the harmonic entropy list, and the other led to \nthe \n&gt; &gt;creation of the tuning-math list.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is interesting, because I&#39;ve long rebelled at the thought that \ntuning \n&gt; and microtonal music HAS to be thought of as a niche. I truly \nbelieve that, \n&gt; with advances in the understanding of the physics of sound, the \ntools we \n&gt; have at our disposal, and the unbelievably broad palette of what we \ncan \n&gt; call &#39;music&#39;, this world - tuning - is very much large enough to \nsupport \n&gt; differing interest groups *without* it being a priori a negative or \n&gt; combative or competitive situation.\n\nSure. I share that view. Not sure what it has to do with the \nprecedent.\n\n&gt; I still read tuning. I continue to urge people to go their for the \nkind of \n&gt; information they will find there.\n\nAnd the kind of people they will meet. Aaron and I had a Yahoo \nmessenger chat yesterday that left me with a warm feeling, and \nexcitement for what the future of our relationship will bring. Just \nbecause someone happened to choose to sign up for the tuning list \ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;d be a bad person to get to know . . .\n\n&gt; &gt;The initial formation of the PM list came a surprise to many of us \nbecause \n&gt; &gt;there was never any indication that anyone on the tuning list \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt;have welcomed *more* posting on practical matters, sharing of \nmusic, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone is interested, they might investigate how and what \nsurprises them.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what to take from that statement.\n\nBack to real life (I hope),\nPaul\n\n\n"

However, I thought I&#39;d give my perspective.  The internet has been a\nfantastic tool for learning about what&#39;s happening in microtonality.  I\njoined &quot;MMM&quot; a few months ago, then &quot;tuning&quot;.  After a little while, I\nunsubscribed from &quot;tuning&quot; and continued reading &quot;MMM.&quot;  That&#39;s how I plan\nto keep it.\n\nThere were four things that turned me off about &quot;tuning.&quot;\n\n1. Too much!  I&#39;d get dozens of emails a day.  I couldn&#39;t keep up with that.\n2. A lot of it made very little sense to me.\n3. A lot of it seemed to have little or nothing to do with real MUSIC.\n4. Arguments.  There&#39;s a difference between debating and arguing.  People on\n&quot;tuning&quot; argued.  It was annoying.\n\nMMM is pleasant.  People here support one another.  They share music, not\nnumbers.  I can keep up with it.  For me, it&#39;s a good fit.\n\nThat&#39;s my perspective.\n\nPeace,\nAndrew\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

I don&#39;t \ncontribute to the tuning list often but I rarely go three days \nwithout perusing it. I had noticed almost nothing but arcane number \ntalk for the past several months, which always happened from time to \ntime, but I didn&#39;t realize that others were thinking of the change as \na permanent one. A few replies to specific points:\n\n--- In tuning@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  All you need to do to heal the split is to have your email program send all\n&gt;  the email from the various tuning groups into one folder called....\n&gt;  &quot;tuning&quot;. Voila- no more split. If you instead read the groups at the\n&gt;  website, well, then you must be a glutton for Yahoo advert punishment.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Dante\n\nThat&#39;s true to a point - but what I thought was fertile about the \ntuning list was the way it swerved wildly back and forth between \ntheory and composition/performance, so that each interpenetrated the \nother, a thread about numbers bleeding into one about a compositional \nissue and vice versa. That&#39;s what I&#39;m going to miss, the friction \nbetween them, the occasional irruptions of creative insight in the \nmidst of number theory. A group of theory wonks just comparing cent \ntables won&#39;t be nearly so interesting to look into. \n\n&gt;  2. I would look forward to the day that MMM is unnecessary. I am, however\n&gt;  (in addition to my messy, chaotic, emotional artistic side) a \n&gt;pragmatic person.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Cheers,\n&gt;  Jon\n\nI too am pragmatic - almost to a fault, I think, the result of having \nbeen a feckless visionary in my youth. And so I&#39;m here.\n\n&gt;  I&#39;ve looked upon the split as not so much one between theory and practice \n&gt;  as between (A) a nasty name-calling environment full of endless pointless \n&gt;  theorizing with a dash of occasional pointers to musical examples, and (B) \n&gt;  an environment of people who just wanted to share the non-12 music they&#39;re \n&gt;  actually working on, with a dash of methods & tunings.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tRick\n\nThis is helpful - and is the way I will hereafter look at it.\n\n&gt;  There was never a single suggestion that practical creativity was off-\n&gt;  topic on the tuning list. There was never a complaint on the tuning\n&gt;  list that someone there was posting too much about practice and not\n&gt;  enough about theory.\n\nI&#39;m sure this is true. But I did feel this week just a little, though \nit probably wasn&#39;t meant this way, like I had wandered into the \ntuning list for the first time in months and was told, &quot;Oh, your kind \nhas to go down the road to this other list now.&quot; Like dropping into \nyour old neighborhood bar and the clientele has changed, and the \nofficious doorman points his thumb at the little bar down on the \nother side of the tracks where your friends are now. But if, as Rick \npromises, I can post here now without being flamed, I&#39;ll eventually \nrealize we&#39;ve all traded up. :^)\n\nCheers, and raising a glass to our new home,\n\nKyle\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"

When I first taught myself microtones 20 years \nago, I set up my computer sequencing program and user-tunable \nsynthesizer to alternate back and forth between subtly different \nintervals for hours at a time: like, playing the sequence 1/1, 9/8, \n1/1, 10/9 over and over for hours until I could sing, hear, and feel \nthe difference to my own satisfaction. So for my &quot;Arithmetic of \nListening&quot; alternative tuning class I made a CD with similar sets of \nintervals played ad nauseam. The half-hour sequence I compiled was as \nfollows:\n\nIn electric piano tones:\nTrack 1. 9/8, 10/9\n&quot; 2. 10/9, 9/8, 8/7\n&quot; 3. 7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4, 9/7\n&quot; 4. 21/16, 4/3, 11/8, 7/5\n&quot; 5. 3/2, 14/9, 8/5\n&quot; 6. 5/3, 27/16, 12/7, 7/4\n&quot; 7. 3/2, 14/9, 8/5\n&quot; 8. 7/4, 16/9, 9/5\n&quot; 9. 9/5, 11/6, 15/8, 27/14, 63/32\n&quot; 10. Harmonics 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, interspersed with 1/1\n\nIn sustained reed-instrument tones:\n&quot; 11. Equal-tempered Major triad versus a pure 4:5:6 Major Triad\n&quot; 12. 3/2, 40/27\n&quot; 13. Triads with 7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4 as the third\n&quot; 14. Equal-tempered dominant 7th versus a pure 4:5:6:7 dom. 7th\n&quot; 15. 7-limit minor 7th (1/1, 7/6, 3/2, 7/4) versus a 5-limit minor \n7th (1/1, 6/5, 3/2, 9/5)\n\nIn each case I first alternated the note with 1/1 (F below middle C), \nthen played them simultaneously, and in some cases I harmonized \nentire chords to make the harmonic flavor (I thought) clearer. But as \nI warned my students, listening to a disc of these repeating \nintervals is not vastly different from Chinese water torture, and I \nhave doubts whether many of them will spend much time training their \nears with it. (I advertised it as a device for slowly driving your \nroommate insane.) I&#39;m thinking maybe a web page with mp3s of the \nintervals might be better, in allowing them to control the repetition \nand comparison of intervals.\n\nHas anyone tried something like this? Has anyone had any success with \nrecorded teaching materials for microtonal discrimination? Of course, \nI think the best thing is to let them get hands-on experience with a \ntunable synth, but it&#39;s complicated giving 20 students access to my \noffice and DX-7 IIFD. Is there a JI ear-training disc out there that \nI don&#39;t know about?\n\nThanks for your thoughts,\n\nKyle\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"

One way they could do that would be just  \nby using their laptops and a synth program.\n\nPeter Frazer&#39;s &quot;Midicode&quot; comes immediately to mind. It&#39;s an all-in-one  \nsynth -- a pedagogical tool that runs anywhere. See http://www.midicode.com  \nIt licenses for about $50 US, but also has a demo version you can try out.  \nIt&#39;s a great tool. (I think Peter&#39;s on this list, too, so he might say  \nmore about it.) If I was teaching a course in alternative tunings, that&#39;s  \none tool I&#39;d put on the list of &quot;textbooks&quot;. Peter includes a nice  \ntheoretical paper as well.\n\nOne freebie tunable synth springs to mind right off the bat: Tobybear&#39;s  \n&quot;Helios&quot; is a sampler synth VSTi that could easily be handled by students,  \nit has drag/drop tuning file support. You could set up tuning files and  \ntimbres as .WAV files for students to use with it. Students would need a  \nVST host to run it in.\n\nIf you do anything with MP3 files... do you use some voice saying, &quot;4/3&quot;  \nfollowed by the interval and that sort of thing? Or just use the interval  \nsequences without vocalized notation?\n\n\tRick\n\n\n\n"

One way they could do that would be\njust  \n&gt; by using their laptops and a synth program.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter Frazer&#39;s &quot;Midicode&quot; comes immediately to mind. It&#39;s an\nall-in-one  \n&gt; synth -- a pedagogical tool that runs anywhere. See\nhttp://www.midicode.com  \n&gt; It licenses for about $50 US, but also has a demo version you can\ntry out.  \n&gt; It&#39;s a great tool. (I think Peter&#39;s on this list, too, so he might say  \n&gt; more about it.) If I was teaching a course in alternative tunings,\nthat&#39;s  \n&gt; one tool I&#39;d put on the list of &quot;textbooks&quot;. Peter includes a nice  \n&gt; theoretical paper as well.\n&gt; \n\nGreat idea - I was thinking too much &quot;inside the box,&quot; and requiring\nsoftware as a textbook is an inspiration. But, when I click on\nMidicode, just as I start to wet my pants with excitement, I get\nstopped short by the message:\n\n&quot;Linux and Mac Versions\n&quot;Sorry, there are no versions for the Apple Mac or for Linux at this\ntime or in the immediate future.&quot;\n\nAaaarrrggghhhh! And most of my music students have Macs. I recommend\nScala all the time too, but I can&#39;t use it myself (no Mac version),\nand only one of my students has benefitted from it.\n\nOne of my students, daughter of &#39;80s art-rocker Margaret DeWys, had a\nsoftware program called Pitchfork, which allows you to tune intervals\nby ratio or cents - very helpful, if severely limited. \n\nThanks,\n\nKyle\n\n\n\n"

Will my students know?\n\n&gt; If you do anything with MP3 files... do you use some voice saying,\n&quot;4/3&quot;  \n&gt; followed by the interval and that sort of thing?

My favorite systems are 19tet and 60tet, \n&gt; 60tet because i&#39;m a control freak who likes &quot;beats&quot; and \n&gt; correcting thirds and sevenths in a tonal context, and 19 \n&gt; becuase it allows me to ignore theory and compose from my \n&gt; ear.  \n&gt; 19 tet is great!  you hit a point in harmony where you can make a \n&gt; choice between several seconds, sixths, or sevenths, and the \n&gt; change in a harmony is so subtle, so sublime.  I also like it \n&gt; because it&#39;s prime, and ny sequence you produce leads you \n&gt; straight into distant tonal terretory.  \n&gt; \n&gt; so, my compositions, which are highly hybridized, can be found \n&gt; at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://cdbaby.com/cd/googleplex\n&gt; \n&gt; the microtonal ones are:\n&gt; #3 el gordo-the uber indian classical 43 note scale\n&gt; #4 giant spiral-60tet\n&gt; #8 the gnome-24tet\n&gt; #9 4am-19tet\n&gt; my drummer is wicked, huh?\n&gt; \n&gt; I realize that these clips are only two minutes long.

For learning to\ndiscriminate between really close intervals, you could select those two or\nthree or whatever intervals only, so you can focus on them.  It basically\ndoes what you&#39;re talking about in the form of a quiz.

When I first taught myself microtones 20 years \n&gt; ago, I set up my computer sequencing program and user-tunable \n&gt; synthesizer to alternate back and forth between subtly different \n&gt; intervals for hours at a time: like, playing the sequence 1/1, 9/8, \n&gt; 1/1, 10/9 over and over for hours until I could sing, hear, and feel \n&gt; the difference to my own satisfaction. So for my &quot;Arithmetic of \n&gt; Listening&quot; alternative tuning class I made a CD with similar sets of \n&gt; intervals played ad nauseam. The half-hour sequence I compiled was as \n&gt; follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; In electric piano tones:\n&gt; Track 1. 9/8, 10/9\n&gt; &quot; 2. 10/9, 9/8, 8/7\n&gt; &quot; 3. 7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4, 9/7\n&gt; &quot; 4. 21/16, 4/3, 11/8, 7/5\n&gt; &quot; 5. 3/2, 14/9, 8/5\n&gt; &quot; 6. 5/3, 27/16, 12/7, 7/4\n&gt; &quot; 7. 3/2, 14/9, 8/5\n&gt; &quot; 8. 7/4, 16/9, 9/5\n&gt; &quot; 9. 9/5, 11/6, 15/8, 27/14, 63/32\n&gt; &quot; 10. Harmonics 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, interspersed with 1/1\n&gt; \n&gt; In sustained reed-instrument tones:\n&gt; &quot; 11. Equal-tempered Major triad versus a pure 4:5:6 Major Triad\n&gt; &quot; 12. 3/2, 40/27\n&gt; &quot; 13. Triads with 7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4 as the third\n&gt; &quot; 14. Equal-tempered dominant 7th versus a pure 4:5:6:7 dom. 7th\n&gt; &quot; 15. 7-limit minor 7th (1/1, 7/6, 3/2, 7/4) versus a 5-limit minor \n&gt; 7th (1/1, 6/5, 3/2, 9/5)\n&gt; \n&gt; In each case I first alternated the note with 1/1 (F below middle C), \n&gt; then played them simultaneously, and in some cases I harmonized \n&gt; entire chords to make the harmonic flavor (I thought) clearer. But as \n&gt; I warned my students, listening to a disc of these repeating \n&gt; intervals is not vastly different from Chinese water torture, and I \n&gt; have doubts whether many of them will spend much time training their \n&gt; ears with it. (I advertised it as a device for slowly driving your \n&gt; roommate insane.) I&#39;m thinking maybe a web page with mp3s of the \n&gt; intervals might be better, in allowing them to control the repetition \n&gt; and comparison of intervals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone tried something like this? Has anyone had any success with \n&gt; recorded teaching materials for microtonal discrimination? Of course, \n&gt; I think the best thing is to let them get hands-on experience with a \n&gt; tunable synth, but it&#39;s complicated giving 20 students access to my \n&gt; office and DX-7 IIFD. Is there a JI ear-training disc out there that \n&gt; I don&#39;t know about?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your thoughts,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

I am a composer/producer\n&gt; working in the primarily experimental jungle idiom, who got\n&gt; seduced by microtones.  My favorite systems are 19tet and 60tet,\n&gt; 60tet because i&#39;m a control freak who likes &quot;beats&quot; and\n&gt; correcting thirds and sevenths in a tonal context, and 19\n&gt; becuase it allows me to ignore theory and compose from my\n&gt; ear.\n&gt; 19 tet is great!  you hit a point in harmony where you can make a\n&gt; choice between several seconds, sixths, or sevenths, and the\n&gt; change in a harmony is so subtle, so sublime.  I also like it\n&gt; because it&#39;s prime, and ny sequence you produce leads you\n&gt; straight into distant tonal terretory.\n&gt;\n&gt; so, my compositions, which are highly hybridized, can be found\n&gt; at:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://cdbaby.com/cd/googleplex\n&gt;\n&gt; the microtonal ones are:\n&gt; #3 el gordo-the uber indian classical 43 note scale\n&gt; #4 giant spiral-60tet\n&gt; #8 the gnome-24tet\n&gt; #9 4am-19tet\n&gt; my drummer is wicked, huh?\n&gt;\n&gt; I realize that these clips are only two minutes long.

I would immediately be told whether \nI was right or wrong.\n\nAfter a while, I never made any mistakes. I think 98% of the \npopulation could do just as well given enough time to train \nthemselves.\n\nI think the random approach will work better than a pre-recorded CD, \nand be less like water torture. But I suppose a long enough CD could \nbe made to resemble the random approach to some extent.\n\nFinally, Joe Maneri runs a 72-equal ear training course at New \nEngland Conservatory (open to the public). His approach, needless to \nsay, is more interactive than either a CD or a simplistic computer \nprogram. And all the JI consonances through the 11-limit (Partch&#39;s 29 \nDiamond ratios) are extremely close to 72-equal intervals, so this \nkind of ear training can prepare one fairly well for other &quot;common&quot; \nmicrotonal environments/requirements.\n\n-Paul\n\n\n"

There was never a complaint on the \ntuning\n&gt; &gt;  list that someone there was posting too much about practice and \nnot\n&gt; &gt;  enough about theory.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure this is true. But I did feel this week just a little, \nthough \n&gt; it probably wasn&#39;t meant this way, like I had wandered into the \n&gt; tuning list for the first time in months and was told, &quot;Oh, your \nkind \n&gt; has to go down the road to this other list now.&quot; Like dropping into \n&gt; your old neighborhood bar and the clientele has changed, and the \n&gt; officious doorman points his thumb at the little bar down on the \n&gt; other side of the tracks where your friends are now. But if, as \nRick \n&gt; promises, I can post here now without being flamed, I&#39;ll eventually \n&gt; realize we&#39;ve all traded up. :^)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, and raising a glass to our new home,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\nI&#39;m sorry this happened to you, Kyle, but as long as there&#39;s an \ninternet forum where you feel comfortable, I suppose we have reason \nto celebrate. To be sure, your question about microtonal ear training \nmight well have garnered some useful responses on the tuning list, \nseeing as it supposedly has many times more members than this one. \nBut this community is rich and growing, and if it can maintain this \nlevel of civility, then the benefits you may gain from moving may \noutweigh the costs (sorry, I&#39;m doing my taxes now). So welcome to \nyour new home! (And if anyone&#39;s keeping score of McLaren&#39;s lies, what \nhe&#39;s claiming -- on metatuning -- that I said about the tuning list&#39;s \nsuperiority, is yet another lie.)\n\n\n"

It&#39;s not an ET, but \nactually  \n&gt; Carlos harmonic scale, using mostly a &quot;minor mode&quot; pitch set.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tRick\n\nAh . . . that explains the near-12-equal minor third, as well as why \nyou kept using a neutral sixth (I was wondering about that -- it \nsounded kinda Arabic & cool). I also noticed that the major second \n*below* the tonic sounded like the 7th harmonic (7/8), which made me \nthink 22-equal, but nothing else in the scale sounded like 22-equal \nso I assumed I had heard that wrong.\n\n\n"

During \na period where I was doing quite a bit of music for dance companies, I had \none piece where everything clicked. People used that as a touchstone, and \nit presented some difficulties to me when I wanted to move in other \ndirections (even if they weren&#39;t successful, it seemed important for growth \nas a writer).\n\nAaron, I&#39;m open to *all* your work, as my order at CD Baby will attest...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

It seems there is\na program called &quot;Revolution&quot; that is supposed to run Hypercard Stacks,\nwhich I think means it would play the JI Ear Trainer.\n\nThis is the website explaining that feature of Revolution:\n\nhttp://www.macmegasite.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=91\n\nThe link there is broken, but I found:\n\nhttp://www.macnn.com/news/20786\n\nI have no clue if it works with the JI Ear Trainer or not.  There doesn&#39;t\nseem to be a demo, and the simplest version of Revolution costs $75. \nDoesn&#39;t look very promising, unless you have $75 to randomly throw at\nthings.

See http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers and look for the\nfirst song on the list to hear it.\n\nLiner Notes:\nThis piece is based on a chord progression consisting of seven chords:\nF minor, Ab major, G minor, A# major, A-- minor, C-- major, F minor, C\nminor, F major. Each chord is played 1-3 beats before moving to the\nnext chord. There are five different major variations that play this\nchord progression. Each has a different approach to the sound, from\ndriving unison instruments, to slow contemplation, to reggae-like\nbeat, jazz, and world-beat.\n\nSome of the techniques include glissandi and unusual envelopes. For\nexample, the tuba plays some long slides using the following Csound\nftable:\n\nf331 0 129 -6 1 4 1 4 1 16 0.7857 16 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4 0.5514\n4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4\n0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314\n4 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 ; 0 g30 7:4 D+ to E++\n\nThe shape of the function table takes a note from the 3/2 of the scale\ndown to the 8/7, a drop of 7/4, almost an octave. There are another\n10-12 up and down glissandi used at different points.\n\nAnother useful glissando is the up and down and back function table.\nFor each note in the major and minor 6 note just scale that I use,\nthere is a function table to take the note up to the next degree, and\nthen down to the previous one. An example of the function table:\n\nf308 0 1024 -7 1 512 1 0 1.1 256 1.1 0 .9166667 256 .9166667 0 ; g7 2\n3 1 = C D- B-\n\nThis function table takes a note on the second degree of the just\nminor scale up to the third degree, and then down to the first. In\nratios, it starts at 12:11, up to 6:5, down to 1:1. There is a\ndifferent glissando function table for every step in the major and\nminor six note scale.\n\nThe six notes I use for minor are 1:1, 12:11, 6:5, 4:3, 3:2, 12:7 and\nfinally 2:1. If reduced, they can be written as 12:12, 12:11, 12:10,\n12:9, 12:8, 12:7 and 12:6, or 12:11:10:9:8:7:6. The second degree\n(12:11) is a pleasantly harsh note, and the six degree (12:7) is also\nchallenging. The six tones of the major scale are 1:1, 9:8, 5:4, 11:8,\n3:2, 7:4 and 2:1. In shorthand, they are 8:9:10:11:12:14:16. I make\nheavy use of triads. In the major scale, the key ones are 4:5:6 and\n7:9:11. The 7:9:11, with its heavy tension is resolved to the 4:5:6 in\nmany different inversions. The same technique in the minor scale takes\nthe 12:10:8 as the resolution of the 11:9:7.\n\nThere is a good deal of indeterminacy in the piece, where each\ninstrument has many choices at each point. It may be silent, or play\none of several possible chords, in several different rhythms. It will\nalways play in the same key as all the other instruments. The time\nspent in each key is indeterminate, but always 1-4 or more beats,\nsometimes 0 beats. The result of skipping a chord changes the\ncharacter of the progression in interesting ways.\n\nThe title is taken from a tongue twister used in some bilingual\nclassrooms to help teach English to immigrant children. Try saying\n&quot;stick shift chevy&quot; five times fast. Or even twice! \n\nPrent Rodgers\nMercer Island, WA\nhttp://prodgers13.home.comcast.net\nhttp://www.xanga.com/Music1024\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers\n\n\n"

This goes against the grain \nof most algorithmic things in my experience, and that&#39;s no small \nachievement!! \n\nOne minor note of criticism is that I&#39;d like to hear more formal \ndeliniation--sharp sectional boundaries where contrasting themes can come in \nand retreat and/or be developed. This piece cried out to me for this more \nthan others of yours I&#39;ve heard. Just my opinion of course. One weakness of \ncurrent algorithmic approaches is that these kind of decisions *must* be made \nby a human, global aesthetic intelligence, and not be left to \nchance/procedure, to be most effective.

A relatively recent development in computer \nmusic technology is the concept of a &quot;host&quot; into which you can add \nsomething called a &quot;plugin&quot;.  There are different kinds of plugins - \nsome are effects, some are synths, etc.\n\nWhy don&#39;t you share with us more info about what you have and/or hope \nto use?

Each\ninstrument is presented with a list of alternatives to play at a given\ntime. Sometimes that list is small, sometimes large. Sometimes the\nselection chosen is influenced to repeat the same choice made last\ntime,  or different from the last time, or just random. There are many\nchoices made per second, influencing articulation, envelope,\nglissando, notes, chords, and other factors. \n\nThe tool is a preprocessor to Csound, written in Pascal. Details at\nhttp://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/Techniques/samples.htm. A primative\nexample is here:\nsuppose you had the following macros:\n\n.c__maj1-1 &C.\n.c__maj1-2 &D+.\n.c__maj1-3 &E.\n.c__maj1-4 &F++.\n.c__maj1-5 &G.\n.c__maj1-6 &A++.\n\nThen suppose that at some point in the song, you didn&#39;t care if the\nprogram picked C, D, E, or any other of the six notes. In the program,\nyou could use the random macro facility like this:\n\n&c__maj1-*.\n\nIn addition, I use triads extensively:\n\n.c__maj3u-a135 &c__maj1-1.o+1 &c__maj1-3.     &c__maj1-5.\n.c__maj3u-b246 &c__maj1-2.o+1 &c__maj1-4.     &c__maj1-6.\n.c__maj3u-a351 &c__maj1-3.    &c__maj1-5.     &c__maj1-1.o+1\n.c__maj3u-b462 &c__maj1-4.    &c__maj1-6.     &c__maj1-2.o+1\n.c__maj3u-a513 &c__maj1-5.    &c__maj1-1.o+1  &c__maj1-3.\n.c__maj3u-b624 &c__maj1-6.    &c__maj1-2.o+1  &c__maj1-4.\n\nThen in the music, I can ask for:\n\n&c__maj3u-a*.\n\nThe tool will pick any of the inversions of the 4:5:6 triad. If I pick \n\n&c__maj3u-b*. \n\nThe tool will then pick any of the inversions of the 7:9:11 triad.\n\nPrent\n\n--- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jonathan M.

See http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers and look for the\n&gt; first song on the list to hear it.\n\nExcellent! The expressive glissandi add yet another dimension to your \nalready rich style. Keep it up! You should be getting film-score \noffers in no time . . . :)\n\n&gt; Liner Notes:\n&gt; This piece is based on a chord progression consisting of seven \nchords:\n&gt; F minor, Ab major, G minor, A# major, A-- minor, C-- major, F \nminor, C\n&gt; minor, F major. Each chord is played 1-3 beats before moving to the\n&gt; next chord. There are five different major variations that play this\n&gt; chord progression. Each has a different approach to the sound, from\n&gt; driving unison instruments, to slow contemplation, to reggae-like\n&gt; beat, jazz, and world-beat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the techniques include glissandi and unusual envelopes. For\n&gt; example, the tuba plays some long slides using the following Csound\n&gt; ftable:\n&gt; \n&gt; f331 0 129 -6 1 4 1 4 1 16 0.7857 16 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4 \n0.5514\n&gt; 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4\n&gt; 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 4 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 \n0.5314\n&gt; 4 0.5514 4 0.5714 4 0.5514 4 0.5314 ; 0 g30 7:4 D+ to E++\n&gt; \n&gt; The shape of the function table takes a note from the 3/2 of the \nscale\n&gt; down to the 8/7, a drop of 7/4, almost an octave. There are another\n&gt; 10-12 up and down glissandi used at different points.\n\n*scratches head* 3/2 down to 8/7 would be a drop of 21:16. You mean \ndown to the 6/7? Something doesn&#39;t add up.\n\n&gt; The six notes I use for minor are 1:1, 12:11, 6:5, 4:3, 3:2, 12:7 \nand\n&gt; finally 2:1. If reduced, they can be written as 12:12, 12:11, 12:10,\n&gt; 12:9, 12:8, 12:7 and 12:6, or 12:11:10:9:8:7:6.\n\nThough it probably doesn&#39;t matter on this list, technically you&#39;d  \nwant to write this as 1/(12:11:10:9:8:7:6), since these are \ndenominators under a common numerator, not numerators over a common \ndenominator. 12:11:10:9:8:7:6 would refer to the same chord as \n6:7:8:9:10:11:12, a &quot;major&quot; or &quot;otonal&quot; chord. People tend to \ninterpret ratios as *frequency* ratios, regardless of whether the \nnumbers ascend or descend. Or, 12:11:10:9:8:7:6 could refer to a \ndecending arpeggio, 6:7:8:9:10:11:12 an ascending arpeggio, but in \nany case it would be the same &quot;major&quot; or &quot;otonal&quot; chord.\n\n&gt; The same technique in the minor scale takes\n&gt; the 12:10:8 as the resolution of the 11:9:7.\n\nSee above. 1/(12:10:8) and 1/(11:9:7) would be one way of writing \nthese &quot;minor&quot; or &quot;utonal&quot; chords.\n\n&gt; The title is taken from a tongue twister used in some bilingual\n&gt; classrooms to help teach English to immigrant children. Try saying\n&gt; &quot;stick shift chevy&quot; five times fast. Or even twice! \n\nHmm . . . I was reminded of the bumpy ride in a stick-shift to \nrehearsal last night . . . Just shows you, a title can mean many \nthings to many people!\n\nKeep up the great work, Prent!\n\n\n"

Macs running OS X,\n&gt;&gt; especially new fast machines with OS X v10.3.x run more applications\n&gt;&gt; than *any* other computing platform on this planet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah... Because it&#39;s now Unix? ;-) Anyway, I don&#39;t want to get into an\n&gt; argument here about software availability. Your mileage may vary; my\n&gt; experience may differ from yours.\n\nNo need for an argument Rick :-) it&#39;s true ;-) For example, an enormous \nnumber of command-line *nix apps are just a &#39;./configure&#39;, &#39;make&#39;, &#39;make \ninstall&#39; away. As for GUI *nix apps, more and more of those will be \naccessible too since OS X 10.3.x includes X-windows.\n\nReal-time audio & MIDI applications are a different matter as it \nrequires platform specific code. But there are already thousands of \nnative applications for OS X.\n\nAlso, if one *could* (but why ? why ?? why ???) run Windows XP within \nVirtual PC on a Mac.\n\nSo, you can simultaneously (and interactively) run apps in (at least) 3 \ndifferent environments.\n\n&gt; As long as we&#39;re talking environments... What makes audiounits superior \n&gt; to\n&gt; VST? Can someone provide a brief synopsis of features?\n\nI&#39;ve seen it mentioned in several places, but don&#39;t have a proper \nreference at hand. Anyway, it seems that it may be that AudioUnits run \nat the OS level, while VST runs at the application level. i.e., it&#39;s \npart of Apple&#39;s Core Audio API, which is part of OS X.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_MusicAudio/index.\nhtml\n\n\nAnyway, on the more complicated side of things, SuperCollider is now \nopen source and runs natively on OS X - there is pre-built application, \nor you can compile it yourself on your own machine from the source code.\nhttp://www.audiosynth.com/\n\nAnother resource to find thousands of audio/midi & other OS X apps :\nhttp://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/\n\n- Joel\n\n\n\n"

Sorry if you already \n&gt; &gt; posted this info recently and I missed it...\n&gt; \n&gt; I appreciate the VST explanations. Personally, I use Digital\n&gt; Performer, Sibelius 2, i-Tunes, and Toast on a Mac G4 with OS X.\n&gt; \n&gt; But what I was really looking for was for something my students could\n&gt; use, and they have all different kinds of setups, so it&#39;s difficult to\n&gt; couch the original question in those terms. I would like to move in\n&gt; the direction of a soft-synth myself, but I seem to be a few years\n&gt; behind a lot of people on the list technologically - judging from how\n&gt; easily the discussion gets over my head.\n\nHmm... you&#39;re right, it&#39;s kinda tough asking on the behalf of a group\nof people where everyone&#39;s setup is going to vary.\n\nWhat do you plan to have your students do with software synths,\nbesides tune them to different scales?  Are they going to use\nsequencers or play them with MIDI keyboards?\n\nSeems like the simplest solution is start with what I think Jon or\nRick recommended and that is to get Bidule here:  \n\nhttp://www.plogue.com/\n\nAs previously mentioned, you need a VST host application into which\nyou can &quot;plug in&quot; VST instruments.  Bidule is currently a beta\nproduct, and thus free.\n\nNext, get CronoX, which is a low-cost VST synth that can load tuning\nfiles -  I don&#39;t know exactly what format, perhaps a CronoX user on\nthis Group can tell you.  You can &quot;plug&quot; CronoX &quot;into&quot; Bidule.\n\nThat should be simple enough to get you started with microtunable Mac\nOS X soft synths.\n\nPaolo\n\n\n"

Are they going to use\n&gt; sequencers or play them with MIDI keyboards?\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems like the simplest solution is start with what I think Jon or\n&gt; Rick recommended and that is to get Bidule here:  \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.plogue.com/\n\nWell, my original question asked advice about what to put on a compact\ndisc to help students learn to distinguish JI intervals, and it kind\nof snowballed into questions involving entire MIDI studios and\nsoftware so advanced it&#39;s not compatible with *anything* yet. I\nappreciate the expansion, because it gives me ideas toward which I\nmight be able to tend in the future - we&#39;re building a new computer\nroom for the music students, and I now have some slim premonition how\nI might make sure microtonality will be involved. But the questions\nare beginning to feel a little parallel to &quot;Have you stopped beating\nyour wife?&quot; (Keep in mind, I only last summer reached the point of\nbeing able to burn my own CDs.) \n\nI&#39;ll try Plogue, as I&#39;ve been trying out every suggestion made, and I\ngave all the appropriate URLs to my students - perhaps some of them\nwill succeed in using them where I&#39;ve failed. It looks like I should\nmaybe work with our computer music guy, Bob Bielecki, to see that we\nhave some of these soft-synths and plug-ins in our new studio so we\ncan have a permanent JI/x-ET ear-training lab. Thanks for all the\nsoftware names and URLs, and I&#39;ll blast away at this VST stuff to see\nif I can eventually make sense of it.\n\nCheers,\n\nKyle\n\n\n\n"

For example, do you \nalternate\n&gt; semitones with quarter-tones? Do you give verbal information\n&gt; identifying interval sizes? Do you arrange the semitones, sixth-\ntones,\n&gt; etc., in scales? Do you present the intervals slowly enough to sing\n&gt; back with? repetitively? I&#39;m curious to find what people have tried\n&gt; and what might work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle\n\n\n***Hi Kyle,\n\nWell, I&#39;ll take this from the &quot;instructions&quot; for _Blackjack_, the \ncello/electronics piece:\n\nThe description begins telling the player how Blackjack is close to \nJI (up to the 11 limit, within 2 or 3 cents) and how it is, \nbasically, easy to play because it uses 72-tET notation, i.e. our \nbasic 12-equal pitches, PLUS, quartertones, 1/6th tones, and 1/12th \ntone alterations.\n\nThen it shows the symbols I use (in this particular piece I am using \nthe Ezra Sims, symbols... since then I have a modified form of George \nSecor&#39;s &quot;sagittal&quot; which seems even better)\n\n1/6 tones being approximately 33 cents deviation high and low from \nthe 12-equal pitches and\n\n1/12th tones being approximately 16 cents up and down from the 12-\nequal pitches.\n\nSince those are the only accidentals (besides quartertones) necessary \nin Blackjack, that&#39;s pretty simple..\n\nOn the first track of the accompanying CD I have &quot;Blackjack note \npractice.&quot;  Each example is repeated twice, and there is space \nbetween the examples.  They go as follows: (I also indicate TIMINGS \non the CD so that a person knows *for sure* what pitch he/she is \non!)  Essentially I just follow the 12-equal chromatic scale with \nthis, including the deviations that are necessary for the Blackjack \nscale.  Each pitch is about 2 or 3 seconds in length.  These are the \ncomparisions:\n\n0:00 C natural\n\n0:13 C#, C# 12th tone low \n\n0:58 Db, Db 12th tone high\n\n1:44 D natural, D 6th tone high\n\n2:31 Eb, Eb 12th tone high\n\n3:19 E natural, E quarter tone low\n\n4:11 E natural, E 6th tone high\n\n5:09 F natural, F 6th tone low\n\n6:01 F natural, F quarter tone high\n\n6:56 F#, F# 12th tone low\n\n7:49 G natural, G 6th tone low\n\n8:43 G#, G# 12th tone low\n\n9:39 Ab, Ab 12th tone high\n\n10:38 A natural, A 6th tone high\n\n11:34 Bb, Bb 12th tone high\n\n12:30 B natural, B quarter tone low\n\n13:28 B natural, B 12th tone low\n\n14:24 C natural, C 6th tone low\n\n15:16 C natural (one octave about original...)\n\n****\n\nThen, TRACK 2 of the CD, is the 21-note blackjack scale through a one \noctave range, ascending and descending.  It is played twice...  I \nnote that there are essentially only *two* different step sizes in \nBlackjack, one 83 cents (five 72-tET units) and the other 33 cents \n(two 72-tET units)\n\nThen I show a graphic of the scale (that was a bitch to import in \nfrom Sibelius, but I hear they&#39;ve improved graphic import to Word by \nnow... :)  with the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;L&quot; labels for the intervals indicated \nbetween the notes...\n\nTRACK 3:  is the cello part ALONE.  I had been asked to have this \nkind of track from instrumentalists before, so they could practice \ntheir intonation only against the one line...\n\nTRACK 4:  This is the piece WITH a MIDI realization of the cello \npart, for practice purposes only...\n\nTRACK 5:  Finally, this is the track that will be performed in \nconcert... the MIDI accompaniment *without* the cello part.  I put \nthis last on the CD for obvious reasons:  that way there will be \nnothing after it in case the engineer messes up and forgets to turn \nthe CD off... :)  (that&#39;s happened, of course)...\n\nThat&#39;s basically it, and I&#39;ve been using a similar procedure for all \nmy solo Blackjack pieces... although it&#39;s been somewhat &quot;refined&quot; as \nI went along...\n\nbest,\n\nJoe Pehrson\n\n\n\n\n"

Help Jon!\n\nMy e-mail was intended to inform anyone on this list already using / \nconsidering Mac OS X about it&#39;s possibilities. The &#39;why?...&#39; bit was a \ncomment that there is enough software (for music or otherwise) available \nfor Mac OS X to not require running Windows software.\n\nOS X is a complex beast though deceptively simple in it&#39;s appearance, \nand I know that pretty much no OS X user knows all the possibilities it \npresents. For example, to some extent I can run unix commands right now \nwithin my e-mail app, within the e-mail I&#39;m typing. It would be \ninteresting if there was a way to do something musically useful at the \nspur of the moment without having to first launch the actual \napplication - even as much as run a Scala, Csound, or Common Music \ncommand on a whim. Actually I think this may be currently possible. I&#39;m \neagerly waiting to upgrade to a new quick machine to try & work more \nflexibly.\n\nScala (Manuel - happy to hear a GUI Scala for OS X will be available \nsoon !)\nhttp://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/\n\nCsound\nhttp://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/frontpage.html\nhttp://csounds.com/matt/MacCsound/\n\nCommon Music\nhttp://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/doc/cm.html\n\n\nAnyway, what I was trying to say, relevant to anyone using OS X for \nmusic :\n\n- the ability to use unix, Windows, &#39;Classic&#39; Mac, & native OS X\n- websites where an OS X user can find OS X audio/MIDI & other software\n- specific software available for OS X - FM7 & SuperCollider\n\nThere was no intent to try & convince anyone using another OS about \nanything, simply to inform Mac users here.\n\nCheers,\n- Joel\n\n\n\n"

Where should I start??  (Sorry not to be the researcher \nin this, but there are some on this list who are more qualified in \nthis department than myself, I&#39;ll have to confess... :)\n\nI&#39;m hoping to eventually replace my TX81Zs with softsynths for \nmicrotonal compositon, if that&#39;s feasible...\n\nThanks!\n\nJ.

You mentioned the M-Audio Audiophile 2496. I looked up this  \ncard on Google, but can&#39;t find out directly if it&#39;s a &quot;full duplex&quot; card  \nor not.\n\nI currently have a Storm Platinum card (aka Aureal Vortex). I can send  \noutput to the card with an application, while simultaneously recording the  \ncard&#39;s output in another application. Can you do that with the M-Audio  \nAudiophile 2496?\n\nI need to do such recording sometimes with applications that cannot  \ndirectly save a WAV file to disk. With some VST hosts you can select an  \noption to send the output to disk, but there are other programs I sometimes  \nuse that just send their output to the default audio card without any  \noptions. To record those, I just fire up CoolEdit at the same time and have  \nCoolEdit capture the &quot;Stereo Mixer&quot; signal of the card. Works  \nbeautifully... The card that came with my machine (&quot;Sony Soundmax Digital  \nAudio&quot;) doesn&#39;t allow me to do that, which really sucks.\n\nI&#39;m looking for a card other than the now old Aureal Vortex which supports  \nthe simultaneous record feature.\n\nALso, I notice in this review:\nhttp://www.digit-life.com/articles/maudioaudiophile/\nit only rates the M-Audio card at 40Hz to 15kHz with line in/out, even at  \nhigh sample rates. That&#39;s not very good. Can other cards do better?\n\n\n\tRick\n\n"

You mentioned the M-Audio Audiophile 2496. I looked \nup this  \n&gt; card on Google, but can&#39;t find out directly if it&#39;s a &quot;full duplex&quot; \ncard  \n&gt; or not.\n&gt; \n\n***Yes, it is 2 X 2 full duplex.  Jon Szanto had the brilliant idea \nthat we might actually check the M-Audio website... :)  Good call!  :)\n\n\n&gt; I currently have a Storm Platinum card (aka Aureal Vortex). I can \nsend  \n&gt; output to the card with an application, while simultaneously \nrecording the  \n&gt; card&#39;s output in another application. Can you do that with the M-\nAudio  \n&gt; Audiophile 2496?\n&gt; \n\n***I&#39;m assuming that with two outputs this is possible... (??)\n\n\n&gt; I need to do such recording sometimes with applications that \ncannot  \n&gt; directly save a WAV file to disk. With some VST hosts you can \nselect an  \n&gt; option to send the output to disk, but there are other programs I \nsometimes  \n&gt; use that just send their output to the default audio card without \nany  \n&gt; options. To record those, I just fire up CoolEdit at the same time \nand have  \n&gt; CoolEdit capture the &quot;Stereo Mixer&quot; signal of the card. Works  \n&gt; beautifully... The card that came with my machine (&quot;Sony Soundmax \nDigital  \n&gt; Audio&quot;) doesn&#39;t allow me to do that, which really sucks.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a card other than the now old Aureal Vortex which \nsupports  \n&gt; the simultaneous record feature.\n&gt; \n&gt; ALso, I notice in this review:\n&gt; http://www.digit-life.com/articles/maudioaudiophile/\n&gt; it only rates the M-Audio card at 40Hz to 15kHz with line in/out, \neven at  \n&gt; high sample rates. That&#39;s not very good. Can other cards do better?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n***It says here 4x4, 24-bit/96khz, full-duplex recording interface \nwith MIDI I/O...\n\nI guess that&#39;s higher than the review, right??\n\nI also have an older SoundBlaster 128 that only lets me output one \napplication at a time.  If I have Sibelius running, for instance, it \nwon&#39;t let me play back audio from the web.\n\nSimilarly, I have to actually start up Sibelius, and then *minimize* \nit before opening SoundForge to record the audio output... or \nSibelius &quot;hogs&quot; the one output...\n\nThanks, Rick!\n\nJP\n\n\n"

If a mic pre or having S/PDIF (digital \ninput say for use with a DAT) is important check out the M-Audio \nDelta66/Omni combo (slightly more than the 44).. I recommend Ebay for these \nitems...\n\nOf course your biggest enjoyment will be pairing your new computer/audio \ninterface with some small decent project studio speakers... Mackie HR624s \nare what I recommend for this price range.\n\nThe laundry list of small improvements goes further of course.. :)\n\nRick:\n &gt;it only rates the M-Audio card at 40Hz to 15kHz with line in/out, even at\n &gt;high sample rates. That&#39;s not very good. Can other cards do better?\n\nJon:\n &gt;Well, their specs say &quot;Dynamic Range: D/A 104.0dB (a-weighted), A/D \n100.4dB (a-weighted); THD: less than 0.002%; Freq. Response: 22Hz - 22kHz, \n-0.4,-0.4dB\n\nPhew... That must have been a review for an early model Audiophile 2496 as \nthe stats from the link Rick posted were poor.\n\nOne of the most important stats to examine when buying a sound card is its \ndynamic range.  This stat is a big determining factor on the quality of the \ncard (and your recordings). None of the prosumer companies, MAudio, MOTU, \nAardvark, etc. promote this stat much; sure all of them will boast \n24bit/96khz, but that is not the limiting factor of the interface.\n\nMost prosumer interfaces are now pushing upwards of 104 to 108 dBA.\n\nI progressed from a Delta 44 -&gt; Aardvark Q10 -&gt; LynxStudio LynxTwo..\nThe LynxStudio interfaces being the low mark for pro interfaces; coming in \nwith a dynamic range of 115dBA.  It is remarkably better than the Delta or \nAardvark cards I previously used; to improve on it I&#39;d need to spend at \nleast $2k for outboard converters;  The Benchmark DAC1 and ADC1 being high \ncandidates there.  The nice thing about the LynxStudio card is that it also \nprovides AES ins/outs that are necessary to connect external converters.\n\nLynxStudio does offer the LS-22 which is a 2in/2out version, but that is \nstill a little pricey (~$600), but so worth it if you don&#39;t need a lot of \nins/outs.\n\nBest,\n--Mike \n\n\n\n"

Can other cards do \nbetter?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jon:\n&gt;  &gt;Well, their specs say &quot;Dynamic Range: D/A 104.0dB (a-weighted), \nA/D \n&gt; 100.4dB (a-weighted); THD: less than 0.002%; Freq. Response: 22Hz - \n22kHz, \n&gt; -0.4,-0.4dB\n&gt; \n&gt; Phew... That must have been a review for an early model Audiophile \n2496 as \n&gt; the stats from the link Rick posted were poor.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the most important stats to examine when buying a sound card \nis its \n&gt; dynamic range.  This stat is a big determining factor on the \nquality of the \n&gt; card (and your recordings). None of the prosumer companies, MAudio, \nMOTU, \n&gt; Aardvark, etc. promote this stat much; sure all of them will boast \n&gt; 24bit/96khz, but that is not the limiting factor of the interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most prosumer interfaces are now pushing upwards of 104 to 108 dBA.\n&gt; \n&gt; I progressed from a Delta 44 -&gt; Aardvark Q10 -&gt; LynxStudio LynxTwo..\n&gt; The LynxStudio interfaces being the low mark for pro interfaces; \ncoming in \n&gt; with a dynamic range of 115dBA.  It is remarkably better than the \nDelta or \n&gt; Aardvark cards I previously used; to improve on it I&#39;d need to \nspend at \n&gt; least $2k for outboard converters;  The Benchmark DAC1 and ADC1 \nbeing high \n&gt; candidates there.  The nice thing about the LynxStudio card is that \nit also \n&gt; provides AES ins/outs that are necessary to connect external \nconverters.\n&gt; \n&gt; LynxStudio does offer the LS-22 which is a 2in/2out version, but \nthat is \n&gt; still a little pricey (~$600), but so worth it if you don&#39;t need a \nlot of \n&gt; ins/outs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; --Mike\n\n\n***Thanks so much for the info., Mike, and nice to see you&#39;re posting \nagain...\n\nJoe P.\n\n\n"

Putting a softsynth into the project is no different than using a \nhardware box. You have a track that goes to the softsynth, and you play \nyour midi keyboard. Instead of the midi signals going out a midi cable and \nthe sound coming out of audio cables from, say, a TX81Z, the midi signals \nare routed internally and the sound goes right to your audio \ncard/interface. Think of it as when you play with Fractal Tune Smithy or \nScala, where the sound comes right off the soundcard.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Putting a softsynth into the project is no different than \nusing a \n&gt; hardware box. You have a track that goes to the softsynth, and you \nplay \n&gt; your midi keyboard. Instead of the midi signals going out a midi \ncable and \n&gt; the sound coming out of audio cables from, say, a TX81Z, the midi \nsignals \n&gt; are routed internally and the sound goes right to your audio \n&gt; card/interface. Think of it as when you play with Fractal Tune \nSmithy or \n&gt; Scala, where the sound comes right off the soundcard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jon\n\n\n***Got it!

It is a very \neasy program to tweak the sounds in.\n\n&gt;Do you have any sound samples?\n\nIf you go to the link I sent you, there are at least 4 mp3 demos you can \ndownload that would give you a complete idea of the sounds. Also, as in \nyour above question, the demo is completely *free*, so instead of relying \non other peoples ideas about a softsynth, you should try downloading and \nusing it. I can&#39;t *guarantee* it will work on your system, but if you \ncombine either the free demo of &quot;Forte&quot; (a VST host) or the completely free \n&quot;Bidule&quot; (www.plogue.com - I think) you should be able to run it on even a \nmodest system. (see more below)\n\n&gt;And did you purchase it from the website?  I notice the price was in \n&gt;Euros.  What country is it from??  Did you buy it that way?\n\nYou ask too many questions! :) As for purchase stuff, I&#39;ll write you off-list.\n\nNow: there is a lot that we can all share, from insights and impressions of \nsounds to usability of a particular program. But NONE of us would have \nthose insights and impressions if we didn&#39;t get our hands dirty.\n\nNothing will teach you more about installing, running, mucking around with, \netc. all these new toys than *doing it yourself*. So much of the software \nend of music production can be demo&#39;d (sorry that Cubase seems to be an \nexception) and I *heartily* encourage people to download, install, and \nshare the frustration of trying to make sense of all this.\n\nTips, hey, I&#39;m always happy to share! But I really think one learns many \nand big lessons when they say &quot;hey, why don&#39;t I just try this out myself!&quot;\n\nEnough from ListMom for this morning...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

The \nfirst synth is tuned to 19tet, second a 5-note sub-group of 22 (see note \nbelow), both loaded directly from Scala .scl files. I play the scale on the \nfirst, and then five note scale patterns on the second, and then both at \nthe same time (all using the sequencer). Select both tracks and export to \naudio (this is the DAW version of &quot;mixing down&quot;).\n\nThat is all there is to it. You can plainly hear two different tunings (as \nwell as two different sounds), and there are no external processors used - \nall reverb and delay is from the z3ta+ patches themselves. I believe this \nshould answer your question(s)...\n\n[Note from above: this is an EXAMPLE, and tunings were chosen arbitrarily \nto show a blatant difference between the instances of the synth. This is \n*NOT* a piece of music, and don&#39;t ever accuse me of saying it is/was!! :) ]\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

You can plainly hear two different \ntunings (as \n&gt; well as two different sounds), and there are no external processors \nused - \n&gt; all reverb and delay is from the z3ta+ patches themselves. \n\n###That is *also* absolutely amazing!\n\nWell, certainly, although short, this excerpt shows the dynamic range \nof the instrument much more than the puny examples on the z3 site.  \nYou should do some more, Jon, and send it to them, since I don&#39;t \nthink their examples are showing the range...\n\nSo, why can&#39;t I just get going?  Why do I have to examine every \nsoftsynth in the world?  Why don&#39;t I let *you* do the research, Jon, \nand then I&#39;ll just get this thing and start actually \n*MakingMicroMusic...&quot;  (??)  :) :)\n\nThanks for the demo... this is really exciting...\n\nJP\n\n\n\n"

My friends got me out to see Kill Bill (part 2) this last \nweekend... Tech stuff I have down pretty well, but when it comes to deep \nmicrotonal theory I am like a student of &quot;Pai Mei&quot;; constantly getting \nthwacked on the head with the &quot;stupid&quot; stick.. There is always something \nmore to learn.. :)\n\n&gt;You may not have intended it for me, but that is a very timely tip, as I&#39;m\n&gt;wanting to get some project monitors - thanks!\n\nCan&#39;t remember if I posted this here yet...\n\nThe extra little tip that I&#39;ve found really helpful for audio interfaces \nand active studio monitors is to have a passive level control between your \nD/A and the monitors. These can be expensive and can go for about $150 to \nupwards of $500+ for really nice ones.  Essentially, you want your studio \nmonitors to be turned up to line level and you want full signal (no gain \nreduction / drop in resolution) done on the computer to reduce the volume \nvia the D/A; you want to do that with the passive control on the analog side.\n\nAt least with my monitors if you connect them directly from the D/A and \nsend full signal to it; the amps can barely be turned up a hair until you \nare blown away.  By having a passive control in between and having the \namps/monitors set at line level I noticed an decent improvement; plus now \nhave an external monitor control to grab and headphone output (which \nLynxTwo doesn&#39;t have)..\n\n&gt;I got my Aardvark LX6 around the time you moved to the Lynx, and I&#39;ve been \n&gt;very happy with what I can do with it - certainly hit my sweet spot for\n&gt;price/performance.\n\nThe prosumer stuff is coming along nicely. 104 to 108dba dynamic range is \ndecent compared to what everyone was using 5 years ago; though it gets \namazing +115dBa.  Err.. and yes dynamic range is not the only thing that \nmakes a converter sweet... lots more to it of course..\n\n&gt;Mike, sometime when you get a spare moment let us know what you&#39;ve been \n&gt;doing musically - I always enjoyed your pieces/mixes...\n\nI&#39;ve got a page up here if you&#39;ve missed anything:\nhttp://www.egregious.net/media/    mix highlight for me last year was \nTimeless Beginnings; this pretty much contains the earliest electronic \nmusic influences I had as a teenager early/mid 90&#39;s.. nothing new this year \nyet..\n\nMusically, things have been a little on the unhappy side.  I spent the bulk \nof my savings last year to start my record label and got the 1st release of \n500 out in December. I contacted all of the major and some minor US \nelectronic music distro houses and sent out promo packages and called and \ncalled and called and none of them took my record.  Techno (the genre) is \nat a low point in the US currently... I kind of shot myself in the foot by \nnot having a well known producer do a remix (I could have arranged this), \nbut for personal reasons wanted my 1st record to be my own. I did split it \nwith some friends.  Recently the only independent US techno label family \nthat I am aware of did pick up 40 of them; half making it to the UK...  It \njust hurts staring at the other 400 over in the corner of the room.. :)  I \nhave mp3s up here:\nhttp://egr.egregious.net/    My track (Xenos) features an interesting \nmicrotonal analog synth line.. It is hard techno...\n\nSo, until I absorb this release I won&#39;t be working on more music. I&#39;m \npretty much at the point that if something I am working on is not going to \nbe released then I&#39;m not going to make it. Sounds jaded, but it isn&#39;t.. I \nam spending all of my time moving my audio software forward instead. It is \ncoming together nicely.  I have a mini white paper detailing where I am \ntaking things here: http://audio.egregious.net/scream/\n\nI am getting more exposure speaking at technical conferences this year (as \nno performance offers have come in yet). I spoke at CodeCon \n(www.codecon.org) in Feb.. and am presenting a BOF at Sun&#39;s JavaOne on my \nwork. This later opportunity being great publicity for an independent.\nI am furiously working on completing a 3D game demo (based on Quake3) that \nincorporates dynamic real time audio spatialized via ambisonics through \nScream/SuperCollider3.  Making audio software is cool, but the market is \njust as grim as releasing a techno record. I am definitely targeting my \nwork at the game industry & film post production market (later software).\n\nAs far as my audio software is concerned.. I might just have one of the \nmost advanced spatial interfaces developed by the end of summer. I am \nallied with Asphodel (www.asphodel.com) out here in SF.. They have a studio \nwith a 16.8 sound system set up in a 3D array.  I plan on getting together \na comprehensive concert for the fall premiering the 3D interface and an \ndetailed composition/performance including live aspects...\n\nCheck out here for other shows though:\nhttp://www.asphodel.com/doc/news.live.html\n\nI&#39;ve caught Daniel Menche before and he did a great set that was very \nmicrotonal oriented.\n\n&gt;Jon (who says &quot;fear not, List, it won&#39;t be all tech...&quot;)\n\nhah hah... :)\n\nJoseph:\n***Thanks so much for the info., Mike, and nice to see you&#39;re posting\nagain...\n\nDefinitely I really liked the Blacklight live recording; can&#39;t recall if I \ncommented on it last year.. :)\n\nJoseph:\nIs it *really* necessary to have two computers in order to do\neffective softsynth work?\n\nNah.. You can really get away with anything over 1ghz; though more power == \nmore play.. :)\n\nI am currently using a PC and Mac networked via Cat5 and ADAT. This is \nmainly because SuperCollider3 runs the best on OSX and Java runs the best \non the PC.. Eventually I&#39;ll get off my rear and start supporting the win32 \nport of SC3.\n\nFor an interesting sampling technology that just came out check out the EMU \nEmulatorX. It looks very comprehensive and an acquaintance I know picked it \nup recently and was very blown away. I&#39;d reject it as it takes up 2 PCI \nslots.. doh..\n\nOh yeah... PCs and stuff... If you have the will to wait 6 more months on \npicking up a new computer it might really be worth it.. This year computers \nin general will be seeing one of the largest improvements in a while.. IE \nthe PCI bus being upgraded to PCI-Express... Basically, each single card \nwith PCI-Express has the same bandwidth the current PCI bus shares across \nall cards. Some PCI-Express slots will be 16X rated (for video cards).\nMy understanding is that PCI-Express will be launched by/around June.\n\nThat upgrade with the new ATI/NVidia graphics cards has me a drooling.. :) \nI&#39;m doing a lot with OpenGL programmable shading with my software and I&#39;ll \nbe in &quot;tech heaven&quot; with that upgrade.. :)\n\nHah hah.. ok.. enough tech stuff... I do view the audio software \ndevelopment I&#39;m doing as an extended act of composition.. :P\n\nBest,\n--Mike\n\nAudio Services\nhttp://audio.egregious.net/\n\n\n\n"

Once you get a part right as \nMIDI, you can save it to audio.  Then you don&#39;t need the instrument slot \nany more, and it frees up the processor.  It may help to get the tempi \nright with simplified instrumentation, but 32 instruments doesn&#39;t mean \n32 parts.  It means a lot of work, but that&#39;s unavoidable.\n\nI&#39;d much rather get one instrument working well than worry about running \nthem simultaneously.  Even with split zones on my ZTar, I&#39;ve never \nneeded more than 6 simultaneous channels.\n\nAccording to the website, you can get Cubase SE Hybrid for $150, and \nupgrade later if you find it isn&#39;t good enough.  48 audio tracks, 16 VST \ninstruments and 5-8 effects.  That should at least do as a demo, and \nwhile you&#39;re learning about VST instruments.\n\nCubase SL, they claim, &quot;offers most of the professional features found \nin Cubase SX 2.0 with the exclusion of surround mixing and advanced \nscore editing, ...&quot;  So if you&#39;re planning to keep Sibelius as a score \neditor and not use surround sound, you&#39;re hardly going to need more than \nthat.\n\nSteinberg have been making audio sequencers for a long time now.  That \nmeans the top of the range products are very advanced.  If you really \nneeded something that good, you&#39;d probably know it.  Are you planning to \nsynchronize the soundtrack to a video, or run the system live with 10 \nkeyboards plugged in?\n\n\n                     Graham\n\n"

I&#39;ve not only \nperformed (and the percussion is usually the *last* part to go down, and \nunfortunately the timing - esp in the strings - can curl one&#39;s hair) but \nI&#39;ve done quite a bit of producing, composing, and arranging in this kind \nof setting. This is not, for the most part, rhapsodic stuff like Vaughn \nWilliams (i.e. frequently there is a click track), but I&#39;ve even pulled off \nmulti-track orch sessions with conducting. In fact, &quot;stacking&quot; strings has \nbeen a feature of commercial recording since the 60&#39;s, at least.\n\n&gt;Once you get a part right as MIDI, you can save it to audio.  Then you \n&gt;don&#39;t need the instrument slot any more, and it frees up the processor.\n\nThat is a great point, and one that I was going to mention to Joe. I \ndecided last night to try (before you so aptly brought this up this \nmorning) checking to see how well it would work. Since I had mixed to audio \nthe two synth parts, I simply started a new project, set the tempo to be \nthe same, imported the .wav file as an audio track, and hit &#39;play&#39;. Sure \nenough, the metronome click stayed right in sync with the audio, and I was \nable to add more parts on top of it.\n\nI may be wrong, but I&#39;ve seen a number of references to &#39;freezing&#39; tracks \nin multi-VST setups; this may simply be current jargon for &#39;bouncing to audio&#39;.\n\n&gt;I&#39;d much rather get one instrument working well than worry about running \n&gt;them simultaneously.  Even with split zones on my ZTar, I&#39;ve never needed \n&gt;more than 6 simultaneous channels.\n\nBut for others, who think in larger instrumentations, it isn&#39;t just \nbeneficial but pretty much necessary to hear as much of the full \ninstrumentation as possible. Sometimes the composition *is* the \narrangement/instrumentation.\n\n&gt;According to the website, you can get Cubase SE Hybrid for $150, and \n&gt;upgrade later if you find it isn&#39;t good enough.  48 audio tracks, 16 VST \n&gt;instruments and 5-8 effects.  That should at least do as a demo, and while \n&gt;you&#39;re learning about VST instruments.\n\nExcellent, that should do just fine for Joe. I&#39;ve urged him to try the \nSonar demo as well, when he gets his setup.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Once you get a part right \nas \n&gt; MIDI, you can save it to audio.  Then you don&#39;t need the \ninstrument slot \n&gt; any more, and it frees up the processor.  It may help to get the \ntempi \n&gt; right with simplified instrumentation, but 32 instruments doesn&#39;t \nmean \n&gt; 32 parts.  It means a lot of work, but that&#39;s unavoidable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d much rather get one instrument working well than worry about \nrunning \n&gt; them simultaneously.  Even with split zones on my ZTar, I&#39;ve never \n&gt; needed more than 6 simultaneous channels.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the website, you can get Cubase SE Hybrid for $150, \nand \n&gt; upgrade later if you find it isn&#39;t good enough.  48 audio tracks, \n16 VST \n&gt; instruments and 5-8 effects.  That should at least do as a demo, \nand \n&gt; while you&#39;re learning about VST instruments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cubase SL, they claim, &quot;offers most of the professional features \nfound \n&gt; in Cubase SX 2.0 with the exclusion of surround mixing and \nadvanced \n&gt; score editing, ...&quot;  So if you&#39;re planning to keep Sibelius as a \nscore \n&gt; editor and not use surround sound, you&#39;re hardly going to need \nmore than \n&gt; that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steinberg have been making audio sequencers for a long time now.  \nThat \n&gt; means the top of the range products are very advanced.  If you \nreally \n&gt; needed something that good, you&#39;d probably know it.  Are you \nplanning to \n&gt; synchronize the soundtrack to a video, or run the system live with \n10 \n&gt; keyboards plugged in?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                      Graham\n\n\n\n***Thanks so much, Graham, for this advice.  I think it really does \nmake sense to go for the SE Hybrid, until at least I get my &quot;feet \nwet&quot; in this.  There&#39;s not much to lose that way!\n\nThanks!\n\nJP\n\n\n"

I&#39;ve not \nonly \n&gt; performed (and the percussion is usually the *last* part to go \ndown, and \n&gt; unfortunately the timing - esp in the strings - can curl one&#39;s \nhair) but \n&gt; I&#39;ve done quite a bit of producing, composing, and arranging in \nthis kind \n&gt; of setting. This is not, for the most part, rhapsodic stuff like \nVaughn \n&gt; Williams (i.e. frequently there is a click track), but I&#39;ve even \npulled off \n&gt; multi-track orch sessions with conducting. In fact, &quot;stacking&quot; \nstrings has \n&gt; been a feature of commercial recording since the 60&#39;s, at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Once you get a part right as MIDI, you can save it to audio.  \nThen you \n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t need the instrument slot any more, and it frees up the \nprocessor.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a great point, and one that I was going to mention to Joe. \nI \n&gt; decided last night to try (before you so aptly brought this up \nthis \n&gt; morning) checking to see how well it would work. Since I had mixed \nto audio \n&gt; the two synth parts, I simply started a new project, set the tempo \nto be \n&gt; the same, imported the .wav file as an audio track, and \nhit &#39;play&#39;. Sure \n&gt; enough, the metronome click stayed right in sync with the audio, \nand I was \n&gt; able to add more parts on top of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I may be wrong, but I&#39;ve seen a number of references to &#39;freezing&#39; \ntracks \n&gt; in multi-VST setups; this may simply be current jargon \nfor &#39;bouncing to audio&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d much rather get one instrument working well than worry about \nrunning \n&gt; &gt;them simultaneously.  Even with split zones on my ZTar, I&#39;ve \nnever needed \n&gt; &gt;more than 6 simultaneous channels.\n&gt; \n&gt; But for others, who think in larger instrumentations, it isn&#39;t \njust \n&gt; beneficial but pretty much necessary to hear as much of the full \n&gt; instrumentation as possible. Sometimes the composition *is* the \n&gt; arrangement/instrumentation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;According to the website, you can get Cubase SE Hybrid for $150, \nand \n&gt; &gt;upgrade later if you find it isn&#39;t good enough.  48 audio tracks, \n16 VST \n&gt; &gt;instruments and 5-8 effects.  That should at least do as a demo, \nand while \n&gt; &gt;you&#39;re learning about VST instruments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent, that should do just fine for Joe. I&#39;ve urged him to try \nthe \n&gt; Sonar demo as well, when he gets his setup.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jon\n\n\n***I&#39;m glad that both you and Graham find this an affordable way to \nstart.  Sounds like a great idea!\n\nThanks again!  \n\n(This list is wonderful again, Jon!)\n\nJP\n\n\n"

So I decided to upload the pieces onto mp3.com a \nfew years ago to store the pieces in a place I thought would be safe \n(so much for that theory) and where somebody could hear them if they \nwere interested in such things.\n      To be honest, the reason I decided to try 14 tone equal \ntemperament was by a miscalculation of mine.  Originally I wanted to \ninclude perfect fifths in my pieces by spliting the interval into \neight instead of seven equal parts.  Later I saw that this caused the \noctave to be out of tune, but instead of totally giving up on the \nidea (which maybe I should have at the time) I went with what I \nthought was a viable alternative.\n      Perhaps I am showing my ignorance regarding the pros and cons \nof the various micotonal equal temperaments (or maybe my ears are \nsimply not screwed on right) but while I was composing these pieces I \ndid not get a sense that the tuning was dissonant and that it should \ntherefore be abandoned.  I simply went for it.  I took the tools I \nhad to work with and did the best that my ears told me I could with \nthat temperament.  I appreciate any dialogue (either good or bad) \nthat these pieces might generate; for me any dialogue is better that \nhaving my pieces stay on that cassete tape collecting dust.       \n\n\n"

Szanto&quot; \n&lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t make us play guessing games, let us in on the secrets of \ntuning \n&gt; implementations...\n\nI happened to stumble upon a page in the manual that mentioned &quot;pitch \nslope&quot;. This is nowhere near the parts of the manual that talk about \nscales/tuning. It controls, for each oscillator, the slope of the \ngraph of keyboard position (on the x-axis) vs. pitch (on the y-axis). \nThe slope can be set to any value from -1.0 to +2.0 in increments of \n0.1. So setting the slope to 0.5 causes the keyboard, in &quot;equal \ntemperament&quot; tuning, to play 24-equal instead of 12-equal.\n\nOddly, -99 to +99 cent offsets in the user tunings are applied \n*after* this &quot;pitch slope&quot; adjustment, not before as one would expect.\n\nSo to acheive a half-octave of 22-equal, one simply programs the \noffsets from the half-octave of 24-equal that one needs -- 11 offsets \naltogether, key E is left out.\n\nLiterally, this is how one inputs the user octave tuning (by turning \nthe dial on each note until the correct number is shown):\n\nC: +9\nC#: +14\nD: +23\nD#: +28\nE: WHATEVER\nF: -28\nF#: -23\nG: -14\nG#: -9\nA: -5\nA#: 0\nB: +5\n\nAnd then, a pitch slope is 0.5 is used, so each keyboard octave will \nsound as as half-octave -- and the 22-equal mapping is complete!\n\nFor a full 31-equal that doesn&#39;t skip any keys, you need to use \nthe &quot;user all notes scale&quot;. Set the pitch slope to 0.4, which gives \nyou 30-equal, and apply the necessary offsets from there.\n\n&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, we&#39;ve been having loads of fun playing lots of timbres \nwith a \n&gt; &gt;9-note Mavila (formerly Pelogic) tuning -- not just kalimba sounds \nbut \n&gt; &gt;even string sounds work fantastically with it . . . look forward \nto \n&gt; &gt;hearing examples in the next month or two . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; Care to post a .scl of that file, unless it is already listed in \nScala?\n\nSince the idea draws on familiar keyboard patterns, I&#39;ll show how the \ntuning is implemented as cent offsets from 12-equal. When this is \ndone, the notes aren&#39;t in order of pitch anymore so I&#39;m not sure how \nto best express that as an .scl. The pitch slope is back to normal \n(+1.0) for this:\n\nC: +46\nC#: WHATEVER\nD: 0\nD#: WHATEVER\nE: -46\nF: +69\nF#: -92\nG: +23\nG#: WHATEVER\nA: -23\nBb: +92\nB: -69\n\n&gt; &gt;ENANTIODROMIA . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; I won&#39;t even guess...\n\nI discussed this on other lists, and the relevant posts will help you \nunderstand what we&#39;re doing with this Mavila (formerly Pelogic) \ntuning. Though they were not original to him, Erv Wilson was the one \nwho applied the words &quot;Mavila&quot; and &quot;Enantiodromia&quot; to this tuning and \nthis process.\n\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52727\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1557\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1558\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1562\nhttp://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1566\n\n\n"

But the 7-et\n&quot;triad&quot; is no more dissonant than say a 12 equal\ndom 7th, and you can resolve it to the 7-et\nthird diad, which I think is somewhat more consonant\nthan a 12-et major third triad and somewhat similar\nin its role. It works well as a point of rest\nat the end of a piece - and you can make a\nvery pleasant sounding cadence from descending\nthirds e.g. degrees 2 4 to 0 2 in 7-et.\nYou can add a bit more dissonance by using\nthe triad e.g. 2 4 6 to 0 2.\n\nSo 14-tet sounds to me like an interesting\nway of extending 7-et, by introducing\n&quot;sharps and flats&quot;. In diatonic music\nyou use the circle of fifths to\nintroduce the accidentals - but that\nwon&#39;t work in 7-et as the fifths only\ntake you around in 7-et and are dissonances\nanyway.\n\nSo I wonder, how you could get from one\nof the 7-et scales to the other?\nMaybe you could use the three step 11/9\napproximation in some way, as perhaps the\nnext most consonant interval in 14-et\nafter the 9/7.\n\n(I&#39;m temporarily without sound so can&#39;t\nlisten to anything or try it out just this\nmoment).\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I enjoyed them quite a bit.\n\n&gt;       To be honest, the reason I decided to try 14 tone equal \n&gt; temperament was by a miscalculation of mine.  Originally I wanted to \n&gt; include perfect fifths in my pieces by spliting the interval into \n&gt; eight instead of seven equal parts.  Later I saw that this caused the \n&gt; octave to be out of tune, but instead of totally giving up on the \n&gt; idea (which maybe I should have at the time) I went with what I \n&gt; thought was a viable alternative.\n\nHad you split the perfect fifth into eight, you would have arrived at a\nnonoctave tuning.  It complicates things, but in fact, writing in a tuning\nwithout octaves is quite doable.  In fact, some people favor nonoctave\ntunings.  (see http://www.nonoctave.com)\n\n&gt;       Perhaps I am showing my ignorance regarding the pros and cons \n&gt; of the various micotonal equal temperaments (or maybe my ears are \n&gt; simply not screwed on right) but while I was composing these pieces I \n&gt; did not get a sense that the tuning was dissonant and that it should \n&gt; therefore be abandoned.  I simply went for it.  I took the tools I \n&gt; had to work with and did the best that my ears told me I could with \n&gt; that temperament.\n\nPersonally, I think that&#39;s awesome.  The music you came up with is sincere\nand organic.  In my opinion, if the tuning doesn&#39;t represent some idyllic\nrelationship with JI, who cares?  It is a unique tuning, and you embraced it\nwith sincerity.  No apology necessary!\n\n-Andrew\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

This internet thing does wonders, no?  \n&gt; Still, I cant give up listening to live music and\n&gt; talking to unmediated people.  I&#39;m about to leave the\n&gt; bubble of Oberlin College and emerge blinking into the\n&gt; big city light of  Philadelphia... I&#39;m seminew to that\n&gt; town; any leads on good music being performed/composed\n&gt; in Brotherlyloveville?  Much obliged!\n&gt; \n&gt; bubbly bubble,\n&gt; \n&gt; shirley-quirk\n\n\ni haven&#39;t been in Philly since late 2000, but i grew up\nthere 1962-1977, then lived there again 1986-2000, so\ni&#39;ve spent a lot of time exploring the Philly music scene.\n\nthere&#39;s a ton of stuff going on, and a lot of it free.\n\nif you like &quot;Classical&quot; music (or contemporary stuff that\ncan still fall under that name), by all means keep an eye\non the free recitals at the Curtis Institute of Music.\ni used to go all the time, and the performers are some\nof the best in any music school anywhere.  the best\nconcert i saw there was a tribute to George Crumb, and\nit was great.\n\nthe Philadelphia Orchestra has a new home down the street\nfrom its old one at the Academy of Music, and despite\nrecent criticisms (primarily of conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch),\ni&#39;m sure it&#39;s still one of the finest orchestras in the world.\n\nfor new music, be sure to check out the other colleges \nand universities besides Curtis -- and there are LOTS of\nthem in and around Philly.\n\nthe University of Pennsylvania is what i miss most,\nespecially their library, which i think might have a\ncopy of every single book ever published.  of course\ni&#39;m exaggerating ... but probably not by much.  i&#39;ve\ndone scads of research, and i found music-theory treatises\nin there that i had no idea existed.\n\nTemple University also has a very extensive music program\nand library, and is particularly big in the jazz world.\n\nspeaking of jazz, there are more hole-in-the-wall\ndive bars with live jazz in Philly than i&#39;ve ever seen\nin any other city.\n\nthe main newspapers -- the three big ones last i knew\nwere the Daily News, and the weekly Welcomat and City Paper\n-- all have comprehensive listings.\n\nand with summer coming, you also might want to watch\nwhat goes on at the &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; ... there are always\nbig-name acts in Atlantic City, and the clubs in Wildwood\nare famous.\n\n\n\n-monz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"

The proposition\nthat all tuning systems are equally usable is *theory*. My objection\nto it is not theoretical but practical--to my ears, it just ain&#39;t so.\nI would rate 15 as borderline, and 12 and 19 across the border; the\nborder being my own personal one. 14 just does not do it for me. By\nthe time we get to 31, things are sounding downright nice, though\nclearly this is still not JI. \n\nApparently getting within 6 cents or so sounds pretty good to me,\nwhich is a theoretical analysis of the fact of my own auditory\npreferences. Getting within 3 cents, as 72 does, begins to sound a lot\nlike JI. Systems such as ennealimmal, which get to within a fraction\nof a cent to JI, to my ears are effectively JI. To my ears, therefore,\nthere is no reason at all not to temper out 2401/2400, and tempering\nout 225/224 works pretty darn well. Again, this is not really theory,\nit is an analysis based on what my own listening preferences seem to\nshow. Some people refuse to consider tempering out 2401/2400; that may\nmake sense with their ears, or it may simply be a statement of\nprinciple, but it&#39;s not theory with me that doing so, for me, works.\n\n\n"

Dan submitted the following to me:\n\n-----------------------------------\n&quot;Study No. 1&quot;\nFor the Alesis HR-16:B drum machine\nVoice 39, pitches -16 through 0\n\nSometimes inspiration and the process of composing show a startling \nindifference to the real-world events and stimuli that surround them. \nCertainly this was the case when I wrote the bulk of this piece while \nhoneymooning in Maine during the late summer of 1990--this piece had its \nown momentum and its own agenda, and neither late summer reverie nor \npost-marital glow could temper their course.\n\nAt some point in the months that preceded the wedding and the Maine \nvacation I noticed that the drum machine I recently acquired was utilizing \na tuning schematic based on something other than 12-tone equal temperament. \nInitially I was more curious than obsessed, so I contacted the manufacture \nto inquire how, and perhaps why, this machine was tuned as it was. \nSurprisingly, no one I contacted in the Alesis tech department--employees \nof the very company that makes the machine--had any idea; and when I asked \nthem if they could point me in the direction of someone who did, they said \nno! So, having exhausted that avenue and at a loss of where else to turn, I \nset out on my own.\n\nThe Alesis HR-16:B is designed so that the pitch of a given sample can be \naltered by way of a slider that traverses a number line from -16 through \n+15. In this composition I used voice 39; what they call a &quot;pipe&quot;. I used \nthis particular sample because its ponk had a desirable amount of hang time \nand this allowed my ear to get a better read on its pitch content. Voice 39 \nis tuned to harmonics 16 through 47 as follows:\n\n-16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15\n\n16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46:47\n\nThe first line represents the HR-16:B&#39;s slider and its -16 through +15 \nnumber line, and the second line represents the corresponding harmonics. \nThis arrangement gives eight complete octaves (and a ninth that abruptly \nstops at 24:47):\n\n-16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n-15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2\n-14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\n-13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n-12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n-11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n-10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n-9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n(-8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)\n\n16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32\n17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34\n18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36\n19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38\n20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40\n21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42\n22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44\n23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46\n(24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46:47)\n\nSo while I still didn&#39;t--and still don&#39;t--know why this was, from that time \non I knew what it was. And it wasn&#39;t long before vague but powerful images \nof Conlon Nancarrow and Lou Harrison began dancing in my head and I started \nto daydream in earnest about a series of studies for the HR-16 and its \nsecretive just intonation component.\n\nStudy No. 1 uses a single 16-32 overtone octave, and the bulk of this piece \nwas composed on the aforementioned vacation from head to paper and later \nstep-written into the machine in a tortuously slow-going process that \nnearly exceeded my capacity to endure! Composing in this queer and \nrestrictive fashion gives the results a certain character and dimension \nbeyond the notes and the rhythms, as I believe this piece shows, but it \nalso goes against my grain and eventually I abandoned the JI drum machine \nstudies for other projects that better suited my temperament. Recently \nthough, after receiving a generous gift of the complete Nancarrow player \npiano series, I was inspired to pull this piece out of storage and finish \nintegrating the middle, two-tiered counterpoint section into the main body \nof the piece. So, fourteen long years after 99% of it was composed one \nweekend one late summer in Maine, I&#39;d like to dedicate this odd little \npiece to Jon Szanto who coined the MMM moniker not as a hammer but as a \nlight...\nMake Microtonal Music!\n\n4/23/04,\nDan Stearns\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou can take a listen to the piece, as well as viewing a few measures from \nthe score (which Dan had to devise his own notation) by going to:\n\nhttp://www.microtonal.org/music.html\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

They sound near-eastern, or Indian to me. \nAnother example: playing with a fourth root of 36/7 pentatonic scale I \ndevised, I now feel that I can enjoy 9/7 thirds *without* the rest of the \nlower primes, in certain contexts/timbres, where before I couldn&#39;t.\n\nIt&#39;s sort of like learning to like the taste of certain exotic foods, or beer.\nThe very reason to use these tunings, at least for me, is they sound slippery \nand non-traditional, or allow a subtler take on traditional melodic/harmonic \nsense, or are more resonant, and make the ear appreciate a certain sensuality \nthat was absent in 12-tet *not* because it wasn&#39;t there, but because we are \nso used to it, we barely notice it. Hopefully that won&#39;t happen to the newer \nsystems, but at some point, they will be estabished and it will. We will get \nbored, and perhaps (some of us--there are always those &#39;tradition only&#39; \ntypes) as a culture, slowly start to hear what we now hear as dissonant as \nthe newest piquant expression of newness. Or not... ;)\n\nI think there&#39;s no reason to be a fundamentalist, (and to me there is nothing \nmore fundamentalist than &#39;only JI please&#39; or &#39;JI approximations only \nplease&#39;--I agree with Darreg) esp. since we see what that does in religion, \nto which we can attribute 95% of the worlds ills. Why do that to tuning?\n\nThe irony is that *part* of me is attracted to JI fundamentalism--but then I \nremember that I&#39;ve enjoyed plenty of music (most of the music I&#39;ve heard in \nmy life) that had little to do with JI, or where JI was irrelevant (e.g. \nGamelan, Javenese or Balinese, &#39;Silver Apples of the Moon&#39;, pure percussion \nmusic, noise-based stuff, etc.)\n\nThankfully, life is large, and the borders for what is art for me are faraway \nfrom where I stand, and there is a lot of new territory to cover !!! I like \nit llike that.\n\nBest,\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Taken as a timbre in \nits own right it&#39;s very poor, but--again, like the Nancarrow pieces--\ntaken as a component of the whole enterprise I actually quite liked \nit; and if you listen hard you can hear sonic artifacts of it \nfighting the things I&#39;m making it do (weird snipping and clipped \nelectronic junk in the signal). The Lou Harrison reference was meant \nas one of style:I wanted to use the just tunings in a lighter style \nthan I usually compose with while still focusing on melody and \nharmony as opposed to timbre and drone.\n\n--- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jonathan M. Szanto&quot; \n&lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; List,\n&gt; \n&gt; Letting you know that there is a new piece by Dan Stearns up on the \nMMM \n&gt; site, Microtonal.org. Dan submitted the following to me:\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; &quot;Study No. 1&quot;\n&gt; For the Alesis HR-16:B drum machine\n&gt; Voice 39, pitches -16 through 0\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes inspiration and the process of composing show a startling \n&gt; indifference to the real-world events and stimuli that surround \nthem. \n&gt; Certainly this was the case when I wrote the bulk of this piece \nwhile \n&gt; honeymooning in Maine during the late summer of 1990--this piece \nhad its \n&gt; own momentum and its own agenda, and neither late summer reverie \nnor \n&gt; post-marital glow could temper their course.\n&gt; \n&gt; At some point in the months that preceded the wedding and the Maine \n&gt; vacation I noticed that the drum machine I recently acquired was \nutilizing \n&gt; a tuning schematic based on something other than 12-tone equal \ntemperament. \n&gt; Initially I was more curious than obsessed, so I contacted the \nmanufacture \n&gt; to inquire how, and perhaps why, this machine was tuned as it was. \n&gt; Surprisingly, no one I contacted in the Alesis tech department--\nemployees \n&gt; of the very company that makes the machine--had any idea; and when \nI asked \n&gt; them if they could point me in the direction of someone who did, \nthey said \n&gt; no! So, having exhausted that avenue and at a loss of where else to \nturn, I \n&gt; set out on my own.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Alesis HR-16:B is designed so that the pitch of a given sample \ncan be \n&gt; altered by way of a slider that traverses a number line from -16 \nthrough \n&gt; +15. In this composition I used voice 39; what they call a &quot;pipe&quot;. \nI used \n&gt; this particular sample because its ponk had a desirable amount of \nhang time \n&gt; and this allowed my ear to get a better read on its pitch content. \nVoice 39 \n&gt; is tuned to harmonics 16 through 47 as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; -16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 \n6 7 8 9 \n&gt; 10 11 12 13 14 15\n&gt; \n&gt; \n16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:3\n9:40:41:42:43:44:45:46:47\n&gt; \n&gt; The first line represents the HR-16:B&#39;s slider and its -16 through \n+15 \n&gt; number line, and the second line represents the corresponding \nharmonics. \n&gt; This arrangement gives eight complete octaves (and a ninth that \nabruptly \n&gt; stops at 24:47):\n&gt; \n&gt; -16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n&gt; -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2\n&gt; -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\n&gt; -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n&gt; -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n&gt; -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n&gt; -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n&gt; -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n&gt; (-8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)\n&gt; \n&gt; 16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32\n&gt; 17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34\n&gt; 18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36\n&gt; 19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38\n&gt; 20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40\n&gt; 21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42\n&gt; 22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44\n&gt; \n23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:4\n6\n&gt; \n(24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46:\n47)\n&gt; \n&gt; So while I still didn&#39;t--and still don&#39;t--know why this was, from \nthat time \n&gt; on I knew what it was. And it wasn&#39;t long before vague but powerful \nimages \n&gt; of Conlon Nancarrow and Lou Harrison began dancing in my head and I \nstarted \n&gt; to daydream in earnest about a series of studies for the HR-16 and \nits \n&gt; secretive just intonation component.\n&gt; \n&gt; Study No. 1 uses a single 16-32 overtone octave, and the bulk of \nthis piece \n&gt; was composed on the aforementioned vacation from head to paper and \nlater \n&gt; step-written into the machine in a tortuously slow-going process \nthat \n&gt; nearly exceeded my capacity to endure! Composing in this queer and \n&gt; restrictive fashion gives the results a certain character and \ndimension \n&gt; beyond the notes and the rhythms, as I believe this piece shows, \nbut it \n&gt; also goes against my grain and eventually I abandoned the JI drum \nmachine \n&gt; studies for other projects that better suited my temperament. \nRecently \n&gt; though, after receiving a generous gift of the complete Nancarrow \nplayer \n&gt; piano series, I was inspired to pull this piece out of storage and \nfinish \n&gt; integrating the middle, two-tiered counterpoint section into the \nmain body \n&gt; of the piece. So, fourteen long years after 99% of it was composed \none \n&gt; weekend one late summer in Maine, I&#39;d like to dedicate this odd \nlittle \n&gt; piece to Jon Szanto who coined the MMM moniker not as a hammer but \nas a \n&gt; light...\n&gt; Make Microtonal Music!\n&gt; \n&gt; 4/23/04,\n&gt; Dan Stearns\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; You can take a listen to the piece, as well as viewing a few \nmeasures from \n&gt; the score (which Dan had to devise his own notation) by going to:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.microtonal.org/music.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jon\n\n\n"

They sound near-eastern, or Indian \nto me. \n\nOne thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the fifths of 22 or 19, 7 cents sharp \n(resp flat) sound OK to me, but 27 seems too much. While there is a \nnice theoretical argument that higher limit intervals need to be \ntuned at least as well if not better than lower limit ones, my ears \ntell me that octaves need to be tuned more exactly than 7 cents, \nfifths can get away with 7 cent errors but not much more, and thirds \ncan be even worse. Maybe TOP has the right idea.\n\n&gt; Another example: playing with a fourth root of 36/7 pentatonic \nscale I \n&gt; devised, I now feel that I can enjoy 9/7 thirds *without* the rest \nof the \n&gt; lower primes, in certain contexts/timbres, where before I couldn&#39;t.\n\nThis does not surprise me; 9/7 and (even more, I think) 7/6 is quite \nusable, though I mostly use them in triads or tetrads.\n\n&gt; I think there&#39;s no reason to be a fundamentalist, (and to me there \nis nothing \n&gt; more fundamentalist than &#39;only JI please&#39; or &#39;JI approximations \nonly \n&gt; please&#39;--I agree with Darreg) esp. since we see what that does in \nreligion, \n&gt; to which we can attribute 95% of the worlds ills. Why do that to \ntuning?\n\nLiking what I like is not fundamentalism. I stick with what my ears \nlike, and that seems to involve some degree of JI approximation.\n\n&gt; The irony is that *part* of me is attracted to JI fundamentalism--\nbut then I \n&gt; remember that I&#39;ve enjoyed plenty of music (most of the music I&#39;ve \nheard in \n&gt; my life) that had little to do with JI, or where JI was irrelevant \n(e.g. \n&gt; Gamelan, Javenese or Balinese, &#39;Silver Apples of the Moon&#39;, pure \npercussion \n&gt; music, noise-based stuff, etc.)\n\nI like gamelan, but not Subotnick. Is there theory hiding in that?\n\n\n\n\n"

So I won&#39;t make the mistake \n&gt;of having little spats if I can at all humanly avoid it.\n&gt;\n&gt;That said, I couldn&#39;t believe that you would respond to a persons request \n&gt;for books on composition with a curt reply to NOT read any books. Even if \n&gt;you had given a few reasons about just *why* you think that a valid \n&gt;approach, you are just sending out a vibe to someone that is going to\n&gt;turn them off.\n&gt;\n&gt;Dan Wolf is a composer, and he replied with a list that was broad in \n&gt;interest, going from true music/composition books to books that were about \n&gt;creativity in all/other realms; you aren&#39;t a composer, and your choice \n&gt;makes it look like you don&#39;t care to be one either - a curious person to \n&gt;offer advice.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sure, it&#39;s an opinion, and I am not one to get into censorship, etc. But\n&gt;I really take to heart the spirit not only with how the MMM was started,\n&gt;but also the spirit that seems to allow many of the people join. I hope\n&gt;you can understand my point, and give some thought to the way you post.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;Jon\n\n-Carl\n\n\n"

In my quest for \nthe &quot;perfect&quot; tuning, I found that neither an EDO nor JI satisfied my \nrequirements, so I ended up creating my own tunings.\n\n--- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; \n&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s been suggested that a good way to get started in microtonal \n&gt; &gt; composition is 19-equal, and I think that&#39;s true. ...\n\nI&#39;ll start by telling what is *not* one of my favorite tunings (and \nwhy).\n\n19 has often been criticized for its &quot;flat&quot; (narrow) major thirds, \nbut I have found that it doesn&#39;t take long to get used to them (at \nwhich point one will be apt to criticize 12-ET for its &quot;sharp&quot; major \nthirds).\n\nI feel that the most serious shortcoming of 19-ET is with the 7th of \na dominant seventh chord -- C-E-G-Bb is too high, C-E-G-A# too low.  \nLacking decent approximations of ratios of 7, 19-ET is essentially a \ntuning with only 5-limit consonances, which led me to investigate \nother possibilities.\n\n[Paul, re 22:]\n&gt; I&#39;ve found it&#39;s virtually impossible to get most musicians to give \nup \n&gt; meantone or diatonic thinking in connection with consonant major \nand \n&gt; minor triads and the like.\n&gt; \n&gt; It requires a major re-wiring of the brain and giving up of deeply \n&gt; entrenched musical habits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even Blackwood couldn&#39;t manage it.\n\nHow true!  This, plus the fact that 22-ET has no ratios of 13 \ndiscouraged me from working with it.  (But as I wrote you recently \noff-list, I am very impressed with your decatonic approach to 22 and \nhave been experimenting with it.)\n\nOn the other hand, a major difficulty I found with both 19 and 31 is \nthat too often I was tempted to fall back on conventional musical \nhabits.  My remedy for this was to immerse myself in 17, once I \nlearned (after about 15 years in microtonality) to treat it as a 13-\nlimit non-5 tuning.  Without ratios of 5, I was forced to abandon \nconventional habits and found a whole new world of harmonic \npossibilities, eventually devising a 17-tone well-temperament that&#39;s, \nin my opinion, a huge improvement over the EDO.  (I have an article \nin the soon-to-appear Xenharmonikon #18 that gives all the details of \nmy 17-WT, one of my top 4 favorite tunings.)\n\n&gt; 31, despite having more notes [than 22], is much easier -- even on \na guitar.\n\n31 was my mainstay tuning when I first worked with a Scalatron, but \nmy desire for more manageability (i.e., fewer tones) and especially \n13-limit harmony eventually led to my designing and using a 19-tone \nwell temperament, which allowed me to go beyond the 5-limit-\nconsonance barrier in 19 (to the 15-limit), once I added 3 auxiliary \ntones to arrive at my all-time favorite (triple-purpose) 19+3 \ntuning.  Details (including discussion re implementation on acoustic \ninstruments) may be found here:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38287\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38356\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/5903\n\nMy remaining two favorite tunings are a result of my desire to \ncombine a near-JI sound with a reasonable amount of modulation.  My \n17-tone and 29-tone microtemperaments have 15-limit otonal ogdoads (3 \nin 17, 6 in 29).  Scl-file data for these are at:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/7574\n\nAs for where a newcomer to alternate tunings might consider starting, \nI would advise using at least one tuning from each of these two \ncategories:\n\nAn equal division or well-temperament in the meantone class (i.e., 19 \nor 31)\nJust intonation or a microtemperament above the 5 limit\n\nSuggestions for the latter category include the Miracle tuning and, \nfor JI, the following two otonal sets (from which I suggest one try \nout various heptatonic scale subsets), which may be explored on a \nconventional keyboard:\n\n1/1  13/12  9/8  7/6  5/4  4/3  11/8  3/2  13/8  5/3  7/4  15/8  2/1\n1/1  17/16  9/8  19/16  5/4  21/16  11/8  3/2  25/16  13/8  7/4  \n15/8  2/1\n\nOr if you want to explore both 15-limit otonality (on 1/1) and \nutonality (on 15/8):\n\n1/1  15/14  9/8  15/13  5/4  15/11  11/8  3/2  13/8  5/3  7/4  15/8  \n2/1\n\nAfter working for so many years designing tunings, keyboards, and \nnotation, I have only recently reached the point where I&#39;m finally \ndoing some actual composing, and I hope to have some original music \nto share with all of you before long.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

Johnson&quot; \n&lt;akjmicro@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hey tuners,\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me that every tuning system has it&#39;s own mood and use, \na \n&gt; contention of Ivor Darreg&#39;s that makes perfect sense to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, personal taste is another matter. 14-tet *is* rather harsh \nsounding; but \n&gt; what I&#39;ve learned is that one can also pick mellow timbres (sine or \nnear-sine \n&gt; waves) to mitigate this somewhat, and end up with very aien but \nlistenable \n&gt; music in almost any tuning....\n\nAs long as the volume is kept fairly quiet, and there are no \nsimultaneous third-tone dyads or the like, I find this is pretty much \ntrue.\n\n&gt; Of course, I do prefer for reasons of history, etc. those systems \nthat are \n&gt; most popular (19,31,22,JI), precisely for the consonances that are \navailable.\n\nPursuing this a bit more closely (my apologies to this list), of \nthese, 22 has been *by far* the least popular in the West because \n81:80 (the syntonic comma) doesn&#39;t vanish (as it does in 12, 19, or \n31), or pass with relatively little notice (as it can in JI, at 21.5 \ncents), but is greatly inflated to the more-than-noticeable size of \n54.5 cents. I mention this because if anyone out there making \nmicrotonal music wishes to pursue a non-Western-tonal/non-common-\npractice path while employing the consonances you refer to, 22 would \nbe an excellent system for them to try. I think Blackwood did quite a \ngood job of this sort of thing in his 15-tone and 16-tone etudes but \nmissed the boat big time in his 22-tone one.\n\n&gt; Another example: playing with a fourth root of 36/7 pentatonic \nscale I \n&gt; devised, I now feel that I can enjoy 9/7 thirds *without* the rest \nof the \n&gt; lower primes, in certain contexts/timbres, where before I couldn&#39;t.\n\nI know this isn&#39;t really on point, but may I ask you a question?\n\nJust out of curiosity.\n\nCan you hear the difference between the fourth root of 36/7 \npentatonic scale you devised, and the chain-of-fifths pentatonic in \n22-equal? I sure can&#39;t (fractions of a cent!) . . .\n\n&gt; It&#39;s sort of like learning to like the taste of certain exotic \n&gt;foods, or beer.\n\nExactly. This is a very apt analogy, perhaps the best way there is of \nexplaining this experience.\n\n&gt; I think there&#39;s no reason to be a fundamentalist, (and to me there \n&gt;is nothing \n&gt; more fundamentalist than &#39;only JI please&#39; or &#39;JI approximations \n&gt;only \n&gt; please&#39;--I agree with Darreg) esp. since we see what that does in \n&gt;religion, \n&gt; to which we can attribute 95% of the worlds ills. Why do that to \n&gt;tuning?\n\nI sympathize with this greatly. My feelings about JI fundamentalism \nare well-documented elsewhere, so I won&#39;t repeat them here. I&#39;ve \nfought tooth and nail against the ill effects of JI fundamentalism, \nwhile at the same time defending JI and its practitioners from those \nwould paint it as both a musical dead-end and as theoretical folly. \nBetween the latter group and the JI fundamentalists, there is an \ninsuperable gulf which has parts of the alternative tuning community \nin a virtual civil war, further impeding a unified &quot;assault&quot; on the \nmainstream stuck-in-12-equal Western world. Does striking out on an \nunconventional musical path necessarily deafen one to the aesthetics, \nlogic, and worth of those would would take a different unconventional \nmusical path? (sigh)\n\nAnyway, there are many senses in which a tuning can approximate JI, \nand if you combine these senses together end-to-end, it becomes \nvirtually impossible to find a tuning that *can&#39;t* be thought of in \nthis way. This line of argument caused Dave Keenan a lot of \nconsternation, but causes my tuning vistas to be very wide at the \nmoment, despite the fact that I am, for the moment, pursuing the &#39;JI \napproximations&#39; path -- only partly because there&#39;s strong recent \nneurobiological evidence that this is how we hear, and partly because \nmusical history has struck out partway along this path and I feel an \nobligation to continue. The recent Mavila tuning that I posted here \nis a case in point -- it &#39;approximates&#39; 5-limit JI as best it can \nwhile having 135:128 vanish. The result is that it sounds *very* \nexotic -- much like Pelog, in fact -- while being much simpler to \nnavigate than JI. And it &quot;works&quot; -- the harmonies sound like \n*harmonies* -- with several of the timbres already in our keyboards, \neven including some bowed string sounds. If one allows nudging the \ntimbre to better match the tuning, one could get away with even \nlarger deviations. And also employing adaptive retuning (notes change \npitch very slightly according to context) would allow tuning schemes \nwith still further deviations from JI to act as &#39;approximations of \nJI&#39; in a sense.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, life is large, and the borders for what is art for me \nare faraway \n&gt; from where I stand, and there is a lot of new territory to \ncover !!! I like \n&gt; it llike that.\n\nThis is, indeed, the important point. Almost any alternative tuning \nis a great breath of fresh air to work with -- one doesn&#39;t have to \nworry about avoiding cliches. This is surely the way forward in our \nculture -- even this many years after Stravinsky said so:\n\nRobert Craft: &#39;Is any musical element still susceptible to radical \nexploitation and development?&#39;\nIgor Stravinsky: &#39;Yes: pitch. I even risk a prediction that pitch \nwill comprise the main difference between the &quot;music of the future&quot; \nand our music, and I consider that the most important aspect of \nelectronic music is the fact that it can manufacture pitch. Our mid-\ntwentieth-century situation, in regard to pitch, might perhaps be \ncompared to that of the mid-sixteenth century, when, after Willaert \nand others had proved the necessity of equal temperament, the great \npitch experiments began--Zarlino&#39;s quarter-tone instrument, \nVincentino&#39;s thirty-nine-tones-to-the-octave archicembalo, and \nothers. These instruments failed, of course, and the well-tempered \nclavier was established (though at least three hundred years before \nBach), but our ears are more ready for such experiments now--mine \nare, at any rate. I had been watching the Kuramatengu play in Osaka \none afternoon recently and had become accustomed to the Noh flute. \nLater, in a restaurant, I suddenly heard an ordinary flute, playing \nordinary (well-tempered) music. I was shocked, music apart--I think I \ncould keep the music apart anyway--by the expressive poverty of the \ntuning.&#39;\n\n\n"

Those of us without a direct\n&gt; line to God are stuck with having to think things through.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry to taint the positive vibe of this list, which I used to\n&gt; enjoy, but I thought I should share the behind-the-scenes censorship\n&gt; that seems to be required to maintain it...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Carl,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I had to write off-list, for a specific reason: I&#39;ve had a number \nof new \n&gt; &gt;people join MMM recently who mentioned that they liked that it was \nabsent \n&gt; &gt;of the bickering that went on on other lists. So I won&#39;t make the \nmistake \n&gt; &gt;of having little spats if I can at all humanly avoid it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That said, I couldn&#39;t believe that you would respond to a persons \nrequest \n&gt; &gt;for books on composition with a curt reply to NOT read any books. \nEven if \n&gt; &gt;you had given a few reasons about just *why* you think that a \nvalid \n&gt; &gt;approach, you are just sending out a vibe to someone that is going \nto\n&gt; &gt;turn them off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Dan Wolf is a composer, and he replied with a list that was broad \nin \n&gt; &gt;interest, going from true music/composition books to books that \nwere about \n&gt; &gt;creativity in all/other realms; you aren&#39;t a composer, and your \nchoice \n&gt; &gt;makes it look like you don&#39;t care to be one either - a curious \nperson to \n&gt; &gt;offer advice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sure, it&#39;s an opinion, and I am not one to get into censorship, \netc. But\n&gt; &gt;I really take to heart the spirit not only with how the MMM was \nstarted,\n&gt; &gt;but also the spirit that seems to allow many of the people join.

But possibly 22 is \n&gt; even better, or a good next step, because it is not a meantone system.\n&gt; \n\nWouldn&#39;t this be harder?  Why not start with something completely foreign, \nstart with a clean slate,  and tell the newbie &quot;just play around and find \nstuff that you like, and use it&quot;?   \n\nLike 7 or 11 or 13 or 14 or 23.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve found it&#39;s virtually impossible to get most musicians to give up \n&gt; meantone or diatonic thinking in connection with consonant major and \n&gt; minor triads and the like.\n&gt; \n&gt; It requires a major re-wiring of the brain and giving up of deeply \n&gt; entrenched musical habits.\n\nBut if one is forced to deal with something compeltely unfamiliar,  then \nlater,  when one comes to say, 19TET,  one might not immediately feel that \none HAS to  seek out the most familiar territory in the tuning (major and \nminor triads).   Instead one could let references to the familiar &quot;sneak \ninto&quot; one&#39;s music just a bit, while surrounded by all sorts of other \nsounds one discovers.  I think that might end up being more musically \ninteresting;  it might pull something out of someone that they didn&#39;t \nexpect could ever come out of them.  Later they can re-integrate this \nunexpected stuff with their old habits.\n\n\n&gt; It seems to me we should be willing to accept that tuning systems do\n&gt; differ and that this is a practical consideration. The proposition\n&gt; that all tuning systems are equally usable is *theory*. My objection\n&gt; to it is not theoretical but practical--to my ears, it just ain&#39;t so.\n&gt; I would rate 15 as borderline, and 12 and 19 across the border; the\n&gt; border being my own personal one. 14 just does not do it for me. By\n&gt; the time we get to 31, things are sounding downright nice, though\n&gt; clearly this is still not JI. \n&gt; \n&gt; Apparently getting within 6 cents or so sounds pretty good to me,\n&gt; which is a theoretical analysis of the fact of my own auditory\n&gt; preferences. Getting within 3 cents, as 72 does, begins to sound a lot\n&gt; like JI. Systems such as ennealimmal, which get to within a fraction\n\nBut you&#39;re starting with a very abstract thing,  a tuning system, and \nassuming that the sound quality of the resulting music will depend on the \n&quot;quality&quot; of the tuning system . . which,  from your posting, seems to be \nhow well it approximates JI, and perhaps a few other properties.\n\nWhereas another approach is to say,  Given a tuning system, and a set of \ninstruments,  how can I make effective music?  \n\nIn other words,  tuning systems aren&#39;t &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; for the most part. \n . . . . but piece written with them (and involving a host of other \nfactors) can be.\n\n\nGood pieces have been written even in the impoverished 6-TET (whole tone \nscale).  Surely nothing&#39;s lamer than that?\n\n\n\n&gt;       Balckwood Etude in 22TET\n&gt;\n&gt; I quite like it!  I like the &quot;tonal fanfare&quot; in 19 too.  My least\n&gt; favorite is the French-sounding stuff in 16, 18, and 21 (IIRC).\n&gt; But this is probably due to the fact that it&#39;s French-sounding\n&gt; rather than anything about the tunings.\n\n\nI was wowed by the Stravinsky-Firebird-ish one in 16 (I believe).  (Or \nmaybe it was 18?)    I guess it was kind of cheezy, but a lot of fun.\n\n\n\n\n"

As my\nmusic gear is limited, I was able to access easily most of the equal\ntemperaments from 6-24, but not much else.  This was plenty interesting\nenough, of course!  I made recordings in all of those tunings, and I found\nsomething in each of them that I enjoyed.  There were no tunings that I\nthought could not be composed it or were &quot;bad&quot;, or any such thing as that. \nI eventually found my favorites, but I kept playing all of them, because\neach is unique and beautiful and interesting in its own way, and by learning\nhow to work in any tuning, we are gaining skills that apply in other areas. \nI played in 14tET, and I played in 19tET.  My favorites at the moment are\n17tET and 11tET.  (I couldn&#39;t get 22 and 23, and 7 didn&#39;t work either, by\nthe way.)\n\nFor me, 19tET was, well, not that exciting.  It has all the same harmonies\nI&#39;ve heard all my life, and some other stuff that isn&#39;t all that exotic or\ninteresting.  I could write some traditional tonal music.  Big whoop.  If I\nhad only 19tET to work with, I wouldn&#39;t have been as excited by\nmicrotonality as I am today.\n\nThe other tunings allowed me to become free of many learned notions about\npitch that I had and do something that is really new and different.  There\nare some beautiful possibilities out there!  ***We are not tied to 5-limit\nharmony!***\n\nFor me, this was the perfect way to begin my compositional studies.  For\nsomeone else, perhaps 19tET would be perfect.  I don&#39;t know.  It depends on\nwho they are and what they want to do.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend 11tET to\neveryone, and I know plenty of people who&#39;d be as bored by 19tET as I.  I\nthink the best door into microtonality is different for different people.\n\n-Andrew\n\n\n\n--- Paul Erlich &lt;perlich@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, Christopher Bailey \n&gt; &lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wouldn&#39;t this be harder?

The door I used was mapping xennish scales to the same ol&#39; MIDI \nkeyboard and just banging on them.  However, no one had to convince me to try this; \nI sought it out myself.  If someone is more skeptical, they might have to be shown a \nmajor scale in 19 to accept it.  In this sort of case, the argument I always give is \nPartch&#39;s (extended to xenharmonics in general), that one can achieve far greater \nconsonance and far greater dissonance than in 12.  I am also partially partial to the \n&quot;vast array of different moods&quot; approach, but I remain skeptical.\n\n2) Scale aesthetics:  14 is quite happy to my ears.  Especially that 7:9:11-like chord \nthat was pointed out - I am bedazzled.  Strangely, this general question as to 14 as a \ntuning is technically off-topic until I provide a musical example (I will...eventually) - I \nfeel the &quot;limits&quot; here too.  Anyhow, for anyone interested in some less-than-twelve \nside-by-side listening, dig &quot;Moods,&quot; an addition at\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/funwithxenharmonicity/\n\nMy verdict on some low temperaments after doing this:  6 can imply a lot of nice 12 \nstuff. I HATE playing in 7! I looooove 9...and 10.  11 I didn&#39;t give a fair chance.  My \nbanging-on-the-keyboard favorite remains 15.\n\nHere&#39;s something that could be discussed, but perhaps on the main tuning, that \ngrows out of this: we all know that &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot; are dependent on \ncontext.  A tuning has no context at all. 14 equal? What does that sound like? \nWell...are you using harmonic or inharmonic timbres? Sustained or not?  I would be \ninterested to see how far you could push context (I&#39;m mostly thinking about note \nduration) to effectively mask out-of-tuneness.  An extension, I think, of Terry Riley&#39;s \nquote &quot;Western music is so fast because it is out of tune.&quot;\n\nJacob\n\n\n"

The poet and teacher Charles Olson famously said &quot;I \nteach posture&quot;;  ultimately, composing is about posture, it&#39;s about \nbeing able to present a piece of work to your fellow citizens and to \nidentify yourself completely with that work.  By definition, I believe, \nbooks can&#39;t teach posture, but they can be examples thereof.\n \nI just re-read an interview with the composer Robert Ashley.  Ashley \ncomplains about not being able to keep up with activities in the other \narts, for example, in not being able to keep up with what his colleagues \nin literature were doing.  He sees it as a matter of not having enough \ntime, as the time he has is already full with his musical work.  That&#39;s \nlegitimate for him and probably for many others, but just not for me.  I \njust can&#39;t imagine a life without always having four or five open books \naround the house, stashed as if by plan in each of the places where one \nmight end up reading.  Some &quot;serious&quot; lit  (Pynchon or Carter Scholz or \nThe Tale of Genji), Marshall Hodgson on Islam, a trashy \npolitical-thriller,  a handbook on organ building, a lushly illustrated \nguide to dim sum, or a new grammar of Javanese...  what things we fill \nour musics with!\n\nDaniel Wolf\n\n\n\n\n"

The poet and teacher Charles Olson famously said &quot;I\n&gt; teach posture&quot;;  ultimately, composing is about posture, it&#39;s about\n&gt; being able to present a piece of work to your fellow citizens and to\n&gt; identify yourself completely with that work.  By definition, I believe,\n&gt; books can&#39;t teach posture, but they can be examples thereof.\n&gt;\n&gt; I just re-read an interview with the composer Robert Ashley.  Ashley\n&gt; complains about not being able to keep up with activities in the other\n&gt; arts, for example, in not being able to keep up with what his  \n&gt; colleagues\n&gt; in literature were doing.  He sees it as a matter of not having enough\n&gt; time, as the time he has is already full with his musical work.  That&#39;s\n&gt; legitimate for him and probably for many others, but just not for me.   \n&gt; I\n&gt; just can&#39;t imagine a life without always having four or five open books\n&gt; around the house, stashed as if by plan in each of the places where one\n&gt; might end up reading.  Some &quot;serious&quot; lit  (Pynchon or Carter Scholz or\n&gt; The Tale of Genji), Marshall Hodgson on Islam, a trashy\n&gt; political-thriller,  a handbook on organ building, a lushly illustrated\n&gt; guide to dim sum, or a new grammar of Javanese...  what things we fill\n&gt; our musics with!\n&gt;\n&gt; Daniel Wolf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

It has all the same harmonies\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard all my life, and some other stuff that isn&#39;t all that exotic or\n&gt; interesting.  I could write some traditional tonal music.  Big whoop.  If I\n&gt; had only 19tET to work with, I wouldn&#39;t have been as excited by\n&gt; microtonality as I am today.\n\nHmm..I like 19-tet because it is a great &#39;bridge&#39; from traditional 12-tet to \nxentonal sounds. It&#39;s &#39;alien lite&#39; :)\n\nFor instance, yes, all the traditional triads are there, but you can modulate \nin pretty amazing ways. And every interval is a &#39;generator&#39;, since the number \nof pitches is prime. There are 2 sizes of half-step. And two tritones. There \nis a great sounding interval that divides the perfect 4th into 2 equal steps, \nwhich has a non-Wstern quality. Not your average run-of-the mill things tied \nto traditional Western music, if you ask me !!! (Of course, it is a more \nsubtle departure than, say 14tet or 17tet.....)\n\nNot to mention there are plenty of ways, ala Messiaen, that you can create \nyour own synthetic scales in 19-tet, so you *don&#39;t* have to be tied to \ntriads.\n\nI have to say that I agree that 19-tet is a wonderful start for those who \ndon&#39;t want to shed 100% of our traditional roots and start from &#39;Tabula \nRasa&#39;, but who want those traditional type things, but some additional tools \nto add a new color and mood...I think it&#39;s absolutely fabulous !!\n\n\n&gt; The other tunings allowed me to become free of many learned notions about\n&gt; pitch that I had and do something that is really new and different.  There\n&gt; are some beautiful possibilities out there!  ***We are not tied to 5-limit\n&gt; harmony!***\n\nYes, I agree....\n\n&gt; For me, this was the perfect way to begin my compositional studies.  For\n&gt; someone else, perhaps 19tET would be perfect.  I don&#39;t know.  It depends on\n&gt; who they are and what they want to do.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend 11tET to\n&gt; everyone, and I know plenty of people who&#39;d be as bored by 19tET as I.  I\n&gt; think the best door into microtonality is different for different people.\n\nYes, a fact to celebrate, surely ;)\n\n\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Will there not be within some reasonable time a further \nenlargement of it?  To many, the introduction of the quarter-tone \nsystem is the answer to this question.\n\nScales may arise, as we have seen, in either of two ways: through the \nfilling out of the octave with intervals measured by the proportions \nof the overtone series, and through the arithmetical division of the \noctave.  This book recommends the first of these, and the only way in \nwhich this system of scale-construction could be expanded would be by \nthe use of the seventh overtone, for there is no compelling reason \nwhy we should choose arbitrarily among the proportions offered us by \nthe overtone series, or skip over one of the overtones and choose the \nnext one as a basis for further reckoning.  But I have shown that to \nreckon with overtones above the sixth leads to chaos.  The system \ncannot be enlarged in this direction.  The twelve-tone chromatic \nscale is, as far as we can humanly tell, the most complete solution \nof the problem -- at least for harmonic purposes.\n\nThe quarter-tone system proceeds from the second method of scale-\nconstruction.  It takes the equally tempered twelve-tone system as \nits point of departure.  That is a mistake.  We have seen that equal \ntemperament does not offer a single scale-interval in pure form.  But \nwhat can be borne in a twelve-tone system becomes intolerable in a \nsystem in which there are twice as many tones that contradict \nnature.  Anyone who has heard quarter-tone music frequently, \nespecially on keyboard instruments, knows that this is true, if his \nsense of hearing is healthy, and he has not allowed it to be clouded \nby preconceived opinions.  Stringed instruments can make this music \nbarely tolerable, since even when working with these intervals they \ncan so place the comma that the ear hears pure intervals instead of \nan uninterrupted series of mistuned ones.  But this must contradict \nthe intention of the quarter-tone composer, for the correction of one \nof his intervals by the size of a comma is, proportionately, a \nconsiderable &quot;clouding&quot; of the interval. &gt;&gt;  [The Craft of Musical \nComposition, Book I, pp. 50-51]\n\nFrom this last paragraph I would gather than Hindemith must have been \n(at least initially) uncomfortably cautious in playing Haba&#39;s \nquartertone music, but clearly his musical abilities were up to the \nchallenge.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

Secor&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Paul Hindemith spent some 20 pages &quot;demonstrating&quot; that musical \n&gt; &gt; harmony above the 5-limit is impractical in an equal division of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; octave.  ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindemith was clearly talking out of his @$&#*!%. As far as equal-\n&gt; tempered scales go (which allow the complete flexibility of use \nthat \n&gt; Hindemith requires), 22-equal already provides a very clear and \n&gt; striking distinction between 7/6 and 6/5 (a fact I love to use in \n&gt; music, and is easy to sing along with). Even 15-equal can, in my \n&gt; opinion, make this distinction -- with only three more notes than \n12-\n&gt; equal!! Among systems where the syntonic comma vanishes, and that \n&gt; therefore behave in traditional Western common-practice ways, 31-\n&gt; equal most definitely and 19-equal probably have this feature as \n&gt; well. \n\nIt appears that Hindemith was completely ignorant of 31-ET, because \nit would have satisfied all of his requirements (and then some) for \nan expanded harmonic system, particularly in light of its close \nassociation with the meantone temperament.\n\nHowever, Hindemith did know about 19, and here&#39;s what he had to say \nabout it:\n\n&lt;&lt;  Of the systems of more than twelve tones (tempered or using \nnatural intervals), the one closest to the twelve-tone one and yet \nentirely independent is a system with nineteen tones within the \noctave.  It has the distinction of having been calculated and \nproposed -- since its first appearance shortly after 1600 -- more \noften than any other unusual system, but in spite of this it has \nremained theory -- and theory in its vaguest form at that.  It is one \nthing to propose tonal systems; another to prove their \npracticability.  Has anyone ever reported on his successful \nexperiences with a nineteen-tone system, actually sung (and sung many \ntimes) by an _a cappella_ chorus?  No.  Tonal systems grow and live \nlike languages.  They may develop from primitive forms into extremely \ninvolved idioms; worn-out systems may disappear.  But they cannot be \nmanufactured and put into use like motors and crackers, nor can they \nbe enforced like laws.  &gt;&gt;  [_A Composer&#39;s World_, p. 92]\n\nIn contrast to his observations about 24-ET, he had absolutely \nnothing to say about the characteristics of the 19-ET tuning \nitself!!!  Instead, he argues for some sort of musical evolutionary \nprocess in which we are collectively involved, but over which we, as \nindividuals, have little no control.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

A couple of choice quotes:\n\nThis is what I get for reading out of sequence--this is the faux \nmathematical proof I referred to, and which I&#39;ve mentioned before.\n\n&gt; &lt;&lt; In the distances between the tones, there must be some clear \n&gt; order.  The smallest interval thus far is the minor second between \nE \n&gt; and F, and it should not be hard to establish this as the smallest \n&gt; interval in our scale.  But the new smallest interval E-flat-minus \n&gt; [7/6] to E-flat [6/5] would assert its claims.  And since it would \n&gt; not do to provide only one or two tones of the scale with auxiliary \n&gt; tones which were simply slight flattenings of the original tones, \n&gt; every tone of the scale would have to be provided with a similar \n&gt; auxiliary.  And these auxiliaries would have to have other tones at \na \n&gt; similar distance below them, and so on, until we should have a \n&gt; hundred or more separate tones to the octave. \n\nHere Hindemith claims, in effect, that unless 36/35 is a comma of \nyour 7-limit system of harmony, it will necessarily blow itself up. \nAssuming this makes it easy to show 12 is the most practical system \nfor trying to work what 7-limit harmony we can into the picture, but \nthe premise is of course false. One could produce a similar argument \nin 7-equal, in connection with 5/4 and 6/5 and 25/24 as a comma, \nand &quot;prove&quot; that musical harmony above the 3-limit makes sense only \nto the extent 7-equal will accomodate it.\n\n\n\n"

I can understand why\none might take it that way but I would be surprised\nif anyone were to take up that position.\n\nBut - - well I understand it myself as saying\nthat if you make a tuning, even a random one,\nit is possible that some composer somewhere\nmay find it inspirational. Or oneself on some\noccasion or other if not necessarily right now.\n\nIt is a bit like that mathematical conundrum\nabout the first uninteresting number -\nfor those who don&#39;t know it the thing is you ask\nsomeone - What is the first uninteresting number?\n\nThey then have a bit to time to think about it\nand answer it, so you have to name your first\nuninteresting number,\nthen\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,,\n,\nSo, what is interesting about that number?\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n- Well the interesting thing about it is that it is the\nfirst uninteresting number :-).\n\nI should think actually that it is probably very hard to think of a small\nnumber (say less than 1000 or so)\nthat some mathematician somewhere probably\nhasn&#39;t spent a few years studying in some context\nor other.\n\nI think one could make interesting music in octaves\n- in fact I remember doing an improvisation on\nacoustic piano in octaves that I rather liked - was\nonly part of a larger improvisation but\nI thought it had its interests. Sorry can&#39;t remember\nit now but could imagine doing the\nsame again.\n\nRandom scales - yes also found scales.\nE.g. pick up a bicycle wheel and make\nmusic using the found scale of the tunings\nof the cycle spokes - quite fun to do.\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n"

It is only when you tune a specific instrument \nand timbre to it and play specific music on it.  Being bored by 5-equal in general is \nlike being bored by eighth notes in general.\n\nPersonally, I find improvising the way that I do on a piano patch in 5-equal (with the \nkeys C-D-F-G-Bb mapped to the five notes) has limited appeal.  However I find Bill \nSethares&#39; latest composition plenty enjoyable (although don&#39;t you think the beat \nshould swing a little more? Too straight).\n\nIn any case some concrete context is helpful.  Gene when you say, for example, that \n15-equal is on the borderline, how specifically are you trying 15?  I&#39;m curious.\n\nJacob\n\n\n"

As far as equal-\n&gt; &gt; tempered scales go (which allow the complete flexibility of use \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; Hindemith requires), 22-equal already provides a very clear and \n&gt; &gt; striking distinction between 7/6 and 6/5 (a fact I love to use in \n&gt; &gt; music, and is easy to sing along with). Even 15-equal can, in my \n&gt; &gt; opinion, make this distinction -- with only three more notes than \n&gt; 12-\n&gt; &gt; equal!! Among systems where the syntonic comma vanishes, and that \n&gt; &gt; therefore behave in traditional Western common-practice ways, 31-\n&gt; &gt; equal most definitely and 19-equal probably have this feature as \n&gt; &gt; well. \n&gt; \n&gt; It appears that Hindemith was completely ignorant of 31-ET, because \n&gt; it would have satisfied all of his requirements (and then some) for \n&gt; an expanded harmonic system, particularly in light of its close \n&gt; association with the meantone temperament.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Hindemith did know about 19, and here&#39;s what he had to say \n&gt; about it:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;  Of the systems of more than twelve tones (tempered or using \n&gt; natural intervals), the one closest to the twelve-tone one and yet \n&gt; entirely independent is a system with nineteen tones within the \n&gt; octave.  It has the distinction of having been calculated and \n&gt; proposed -- since its first appearance shortly after 1600 -- more \n&gt; often than any other unusual system, but in spite of this it has \n&gt; remained theory -- and theory in its vaguest form at that.  It is \none \n&gt; thing to propose tonal systems; another to prove their \n&gt; practicability.  Has anyone ever reported on his successful \n&gt; experiences with a nineteen-tone system, actually sung (and sung \nmany \n&gt; times) by an _a cappella_ chorus?  No.  Tonal systems grow and live \n&gt; like languages.  They may develop from primitive forms into \nextremely \n&gt; involved idioms; worn-out systems may disappear.  But they cannot \nbe \n&gt; manufactured and put into use like motors and crackers, nor can \nthey \n&gt; be enforced like laws.  &gt;&gt;  [_A Composer&#39;s World_, p. 92]\n&gt; \n&gt; In contrast to his observations about 24-ET, he had absolutely \n&gt; nothing to say about the characteristics of the 19-ET tuning \n&gt; itself!!!  Instead, he argues for some sort of musical evolutionary \n&gt; process in which we are collectively involved, but over which we, \nas \n&gt; individuals, have little no control.\n&gt; \n&gt; --George\n\n\n***Gathering only from the cited paragraph, I would guess that he \nreally hadn&#39;t studied it very well...\n\nJ.

A couple of choice quotes:\n&gt; \n&gt; This is what I get for reading out of sequence--this is the faux \n&gt; mathematical proof I referred to, and which I&#39;ve mentioned before.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; In the distances between the tones, there must be some clear \n&gt; &gt; order.  The smallest interval thus far is the minor second \nbetween \n&gt; E \n&gt; &gt; and F, and it should not be hard to establish this as the \nsmallest \n&gt; &gt; interval in our scale.  But the new smallest interval E-flat-\nminus \n&gt; &gt; [7/6] to E-flat [6/5] would assert its claims.  And since it \nwould \n&gt; &gt; not do to provide only one or two tones of the scale with \nauxiliary \n&gt; &gt; tones which were simply slight flattenings of the original tones, \n&gt; &gt; every tone of the scale would have to be provided with a similar \n&gt; &gt; auxiliary.  And these auxiliaries would have to have other tones \nat \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; similar distance below them, and so on, until we should have a \n&gt; &gt; hundred or more separate tones to the octave. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here Hindemith claims, in effect, that unless 36/35 is a comma of \n&gt; your 7-limit system of harmony, it will necessarily blow itself up. \n&gt; Assuming this makes it easy to show 12 is the most practical system \n&gt; for trying to work what 7-limit harmony we can into the picture, \nbut \n&gt; the premise is of course false. One could produce a similar \nargument \n&gt; in 7-equal, in connection with 5/4 and 6/5 and 25/24 as a comma, \n&gt; and &quot;prove&quot; that musical harmony above the 3-limit makes sense only \n&gt; to the extent 7-equal will accomodate it.\n\n\n***The paragraph immediately above seems very important to me, but I \nneed some more elaboration.  Could somebody please provide a bit \nof &quot;genespeak&quot; translation or elaboration, maybe on another list if \nnot this one??\n\nTx!\n\nJP\n\n\n\n"

I could write some traditional tonal music.  Big whoop. \n&gt; If I\n&gt; &gt; had only 19tET to work with, I wouldn&#39;t have been as excited by\n&gt; &gt; microtonality as I am today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm..I like 19-tet because it is a great &#39;bridge&#39; from traditional 12-tet\n&gt; to \n&gt; xentonal sounds.

I guess that aspect doesn&#39;t appeal to me right now because \n&quot;bridging&quot; traditional music with nontraditional is not currently a musical\ngoal of mine.  I&#39;m more interested in truly different sound universes.\n\n&gt; For instance, yes, all the traditional triads are there, but you can\n&gt; modulate \n&gt; in pretty amazing ways. And every interval is a &#39;generator&#39;, since the\n&gt; number \n&gt; of pitches is prime. There are 2 sizes of half-step. And two tritones.\n&gt; There \n&gt; is a great sounding interval that divides the perfect 4th into 2 equal\n&gt; steps, \n&gt; which has a non-Wstern quality. Not your average run-of-the mill things\n&gt; tied \n&gt; to traditional Western music, if you ask me !!! (Of course, it is a more \n&gt; subtle departure than, say 14tet or 17tet.....)\n&gt; \n&gt; Not to mention there are plenty of ways, ala Messiaen, that you can create\n&gt; \n&gt; your own synthetic scales in 19-tet, so you *don&#39;t* have to be tied to \n&gt; triads.\n\nYes, this is a list of interesting and very non-12 characteristics.  Thank\nyou for pointing them out.  I&#39;ll have to play around with it some more.  I\nthink &quot;boring&quot; is too strong a word for me to have used.  I found it less\ninteresting in comparison with many other temperaments, and it did not\nnaturally suit my musical goals.\n\n&gt; I have to say that I agree that 19-tet is a wonderful start for those who \n&gt; don&#39;t want to shed 100% of our traditional roots and start from &#39;Tabula \n&gt; Rasa&#39;, but who want those traditional type things, but some additional\n&gt; tools \n&gt; to add a new color and mood...I think it&#39;s absolutely fabulous !!\n\nI suppose my interest in shedding the stuffy skin of tradition is not such a\ncommon one.\n\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; think the best door into microtonality is different for different\n&gt; people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, a fact to celebrate, surely ;)\n\nIndeed!  The diversity available in tuning resources is incredibly exciting!\n I like that we all have different ideas about it, too, as long as we remain civil.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!

I \nhave the ability to consume and enjoy consuming large amounts and wide \nvarieties of capiscum. I would characterize capiscum as among my \nessential foodstuffs.  My wife cannot consume or enjoy large quantities \nof capiscum. I doubt that she would even call capiscum a spice, let \nalone a foodstuff.  But somehow, we have managed to find a way of \nintegrating our varied palates within a single kitchen and at the same \ntable.  I find that Capiscum has a quality shared with musical tuning \nsystems: they both directly address our relatives senses, preferences, \nand capacities for pleasure or pain!\n\nThe question of &quot;any tuning&quot; and how an individual composer or listener \nis going to deal with it is far from simple and practically bound to be \ncontentious.  This is due to the immediacy of the problem of a getting a \nuseful handle on the huge number and variety of known and potential \ntunings.  But this is also because music itself is far from simple, as \nmusic is made from a volatile mix of sonic pleasure and pain, which \nmixture has varied over time and geography, and the thresholds of which \ndiffer from artist to artist as well as from listener to listener.  Our \nimmediate problem, as a community of musicians committed to opening a \nPandora&#39;s box of intonational alternatives: how do we maintain civility \nin our discourse about music -- and musical tunings -- when our musical \nvalues or tastes appear to differ so greatly? \n\nThe classification and characterization of a tuning can be loaded with \nassumptions about what music is or does, and we might well benefit as a \ncommunity  from being honest about those assumptions. I have learned \nmuch from research in the natural sciences about music, but at the same \ntime I have often been highly skeptical about the particularity \nand universality of that research.  On the one hand, knowing what the \naverage listener does when she listens can be useful, but I&#39;m not at all \ncertain that I compose for the &quot;average listener&quot;.  I&#39;d rather compose \nfor the extraordinary listener, someone who is willing to stretch her \nears and imagination.  I&#39;d like more research about potential abilities \nthan existing and average abilities!   On the other hand, any research \nthat seems to confirm the universal superiority of musical \ncharacteristics unique to the European (or the Chinese or the Indian or \nthe...) tradition, I can only identify as worthless.\n\nNevertheless, when the best current neuroscience indicates that among \nsounds with harmonic spectra, we have a preference for a small set of \nsimple ratios,  in that the brain apparently processes these with \ngreater facility than more complex structures (and within certain \nneighborhoods of tolerance, insists when possible on a reading as simple \nratios), increasing the pleasure of the listeners, this  strikes  me as \nboth  musically  reasonable and  a useful way into organizing my \napproach to any given tuning.  But -- and again, this is just me \nspeaking -- it&#39;s not the abundance of  the pleasurable that makes a \ntuning musically useful, it&#39;s the distribution and balance between the \npleasurable and the painful.  Consonance and dissonance are qualities \nthat define themselves only relative to one another.  I remember that \nErv Wilson did not become particularly enthusiastic about 72-tet until \nhe realized that it had not only good representations of small integer \nratios through the 11-limit, but that it also had an excellent \nrepresentation of Phi, the ratio perhaps furthest away from the JI \npleasure garden. \n\nAt the same time, those who object most strenuously to quantitative \nanalysis of tunings should also recognize that the quantitative \ninformation is useful to other musicians, and if they are indeed \ncommitted to an anti-numerical program, they owe the rest of us some \ninsight into what that program might be like, or just silence on the \ntopics we find useful.  In my opnion it is insufficient if not \nmeaningless to simply say -- as Ivor Darreg did -- that each tuning has \nits own &quot;mood&quot;.   12-tet surely has many &quot;moods&quot;, and I will even \npredict that the potential for new moods within 12-tet is as yet \nunexhausted, moreover I will even contend that &quot;mood&quot; is more \nessentially an attribute of composition than of material.   But let&#39;s \nsay for the moment that we wish to embrace the Darregerian typology head \non:  what speech acts can we usefully bring to our descriptions other \nthan those embracing numbers or mathematically describeable spaces?   (I \nwrite &quot;speech acts&quot; here because the issue irritating this community, \nnow, really concerns the contents in a mailing list, executed mostly in \nsome form of English or another).  Even if we were to agree to a \nparticular distribution of adjectives among the tunings most familiar to \nthis community,  I submit that our supply of adjectives will be swiftly \ndepleted, by the number and variety of tuning environments we wish to \ncharacterize.  Or, failing exhaustion, the list will be reduced to a \nkind of poetry, or to a non-technical discussion that rapidly addresses \nevery topic but the music itself (a la &quot;rock journalism&quot;).  I don&#39;t \nreckon that many of us are particularily gifted poets and such a \nperipheral discussion is missing the point about tuning systems -- they \nare material for music making and independent of any genre. \n\nPut another way, one of the reasons that there are so many postings to \nthe various tuning lists with mathematical contents is simply because \nmathematically oriented discussions are well-suited to the format.  \nAnnouncements about concerts, pointers to web pages or recordings, \ndescriptions of instruments or notations, and a bit of history all fit, \ntoo.\n\nWith deepest apologies for the prolixity,\n\nDaniel Wolf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It seems to me the hamsters-and-duct tape claim is presented\n&gt;as an article of faith. Why should I believe it? Of course, given\n&gt;enough notes to the octave you can do pretty much anything no matter\n&gt;how they are organized.\n\nI believe because I have seen, again and again and again that  \n&quot;pre-compositional ideas&quot; of any sort,  from ideas on form, \ninstrumentation, tuning, whatever,  do not usually tell you anything \nuseful about the &quot;quality-level&quot; or whether a piece is going to &quot;work&quot;, \netc. of a piece of music that hasn&#39;t been written yet.\n\nAs a teacher of composition, if a student comes to me and says, &quot;these are \nmy ideas for a piece.  ____________________.  do you think it&#39;ll be cool?&quot;\nwell the best I Can do is say something like, &quot;well, it CAN work or it CAn \nbe effective if _____________&quot;.   But I have learned that you can never \ntruthfully say &quot;this is gonna rock&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t use this instrumentation, \nit&#39;s gonna stink&quot;, etc.    Music&#39;s effects and affects are so dependent on \nthe details,  with all of their interdependency and non-linearity, it&#39;s \njust impossible to make such predictions.\n\nIt&#39;s not theory at all.  Just empiricism based on my experiences.  \n\nI have no beef, however, with looking at what harmonic resources a scale \nhas available in it.  It&#39;s just important to keep in mind that harmonic \nresources are not the most important thing, in all types of music.  \n\nAnd even if you find just one measly little cool sound/chord/melodic-\nfigure in a scale/tuning/whatever,  that can be enough to write a great \npiece around.  Maybe even a bunch of great pieces.\n\n\n\n\n"

One thing that occurred to me is that it has two chains \nof fifths at 600 cents apart -- and, of course, a 600-cent tritone -- \nalthough we&#39;d probably agree that it&#39;s rather distinct from a \npaultone (which I might guess is a category starting somewhere around \n707 cents, say 56-tET, as opposed to 686 cents, and also one that \ninvolves a regular diatonic\ntuning) &lt;grin&gt;.\n\nThe main trick, not so surprisingly, is to choose or design a timbre \nwhere the fifths and fourths can sound like reasonably smooth or \nblending perfect consonances -- for my approach, of course, where \nthese intervals are the goals of directed progressions.\n\nWhy don&#39;t I note that one of the first progressions I tried -- and \nplease quote me on this if you would, because this is one aspect of \nmy musicmaking where you&#39;ve been especially influential -- involves \nthe 14-tET equivalent of 4:6:7:9. To write it using step numbers \n(maybe the notation of least astonishment), I mean this:\n\n        16  17            21   22\n        11   9            16   14\n        8    9            13   14\n        0   -5      or    5    0\n\nCuriously, I pleasantly find it a lot like a tuning such as 22. Given \nthe way you&#39;ve made 4:6:7:9 one of my favorite sonorities -- I wrote \nabout it specifically and had an example in an article I did in 1/1 \non my 17-tone just thirdtone system, JOT-17 -- I find it appropriate \nto make this my first technical observation about 14-tET.\n\nPlease let me invite you, if it seems appropriate, to post these \ncomments on 14-tET to makemicromusic and/or the Tuning List. It looks \nlike I might have some technical problems at Yahoo with access, but I \nwould like to let people know that I&#39;m much enjoying this tuning.\n**********************************************************************\n\n\n"

It&#39;s not hard to come up with a tuning that&#39;s not very easy to  \nwork with. I was even thinking this morning of Gene&#39;s &quot;random tuning&quot;. I  \ndon&#39;t really believe that a random collection of frequencies constitutes a  \n&quot;tuning system&quot; -- there&#39;s more to a &quot;system&quot; than that.\n\nBut in any case, early this a.m. I wrote a program to generate a  \npseudo-random tuning table in the &quot;.tun&quot; format. The basic parameters are  \nthat no adjacent interval is smaller than 21 cents, none larger than 170  \ncents. The system is ascending on the keyboard (i.e., not randomly  \nordered). Here&#39;s an example.\n\nAnyone care to write some music?\n\nCheers,\n\tRick\n\n------------------------------ snip and save &quot;.tun&quot; file --------\n; Random Tuning:\n; min interval = 21 cents; max = 170 cents\n[Tuning]\nnote 0=0\nnote 1=105\nnote 2=269\nnote 3=343\nnote 4=469\nnote 5=493\nnote 6=608\nnote 7=780\nnote 8=912\nnote 9=1052\nnote 10=1133\nnote 11=1237\nnote 12=1354\nnote 13=1523\nnote 14=1668\nnote 15=1739\nnote 16=1948\nnote 17=1971\nnote 18=2071\nnote 19=2234\nnote 20=2326\nnote 21=2404\nnote 22=2446\nnote 23=2536\nnote 24=2666\nnote 25=2743\nnote 26=2894\nnote 27=3038\nnote 28=3233\nnote 29=3343\nnote 30=3552\nnote 31=3710\nnote 32=3883\nnote 33=4090\nnote 34=4296\nnote 35=4330\nnote 36=4365\nnote 37=4497\nnote 38=4585\nnote 39=4617\nnote 40=4731\nnote 41=4763\nnote 42=4972\nnote 43=5164\nnote 44=5317\nnote 45=5482\nnote 46=5516\nnote 47=5679\nnote 48=5804\nnote 49=5935\nnote 50=6010\nnote 51=6183\nnote 52=6233\nnote 53=6353\nnote 54=6387\nnote 55=6425\nnote 56=6559\nnote 57=6701\nnote 58=6797\nnote 59=6928\nnote 60=7009\nnote 61=7033\nnote 62=7123\nnote 63=7248\nnote 64=7408\nnote 65=7545\nnote 66=7690\nnote 67=7838\nnote 68=7918\nnote 69=8028\nnote 70=8158\nnote 71=8246\nnote 72=8295\nnote 73=8452\nnote 74=8473\nnote 75=8625\nnote 76=8789\nnote 77=8883\nnote 78=9019\nnote 79=9178\nnote 80=9361\nnote 81=9509\nnote 82=9717\nnote 83=9811\nnote 84=9963\nnote 85=10032\nnote 86=10234\nnote 87=10413\nnote 88=10599\nnote 89=10670\nnote 90=10846\nnote 91=10993\nnote 92=11016\nnote 93=11178\nnote 94=11205\nnote 95=11250\nnote 96=11289\nnote 97=11462\nnote 98=11494\nnote 99=11654\nnote 100=11711\nnote 101=11895\nnote 102=11949\nnote 103=12089\nnote 104=12226\nnote 105=12350\nnote 106=12556\nnote 107=12660\nnote 108=12729\nnote 109=12935\nnote 110=13094\nnote 111=13201\nnote 112=13350\nnote 113=13380\nnote 114=13548\nnote 115=13591\nnote 116=13791\nnote 117=13824\nnote 118=13889\nnote 119=13960\nnote 120=14152\nnote 121=14359\nnote 122=14505\nnote 123=14663\nnote 124=14814\nnote 125=15012\nnote 126=15060\nnote 127=15207\n-------------------------- end snip and save &quot;.tun&quot; file --------\n\n"

I remember \nthat \n&gt; Erv Wilson did not become particularly enthusiastic about 72-tet \nuntil \n&gt; he realized that it had not only good representations of small \ninteger \n&gt; ratios through the 11-limit, but that it also had an excellent \n&gt; representation of Phi, the ratio perhaps furthest away from the JI \n&gt; pleasure garden. \n\nOn this I have to express some reservations, though of course Erv has \nthe right to be enthusiastic or unenthusiastic about whatever he \nwishes.\n\nMost importantly, my *experience* shows that, even trying lots of \ndifferent harmonic timbres, I fail to notice any special &#39;dissonance&#39; \nor &#39;painfulness&#39; at or around Phi (833.09 cents).\n\nTo me, the most dissonant or painful intervals are concentrated in a \nregion between a sixth-tone and a semitone, though this can vary \nsomewhat as a function of register and timbre. There are similar \nbands of dissonant/painful intervals around the sharp and flat \noctave, the sharp and flat fifth, etc.\n\nWhen trying equal tuning systems with large numbers of notes per \noctave, there is no significant difference between their abilities to \ncapture these most discordant intervals.\n\nTherefore, among such systems, the maximum potential for contrast, \nresolution, etc. is to be had in the ones with the best \napproximations of the concordant intervals: the octave, the fifth, \nand the other simple-integer frequency ratios.\n\nIt&#39;s true that Phi is &quot;the most irrational number&quot; in many \nmathematical and even physical senses. But this is meaningless to the \nmusician unless it&#39;s tied to how we hear. According to every model of \n*psychoacoustic* intervallic concordance/discordance that I&#39;ve seen, \nincluding my own harmonic entropy model, Phi is not any kind of \nmaximum of discordance, while out-of-tune unisons, octaves, etc. \ncertainly are.\n\nIf anyone has any empirical observations about Phi to share, either \ncontradicting or corroborating what I say, this would be a good place \nto put them -- especially if accompanied by audible examples. I know \na *scale* of Phi intervals has some special properties, with first-\norder difference tones coinciding with lower scale notes, but that&#39;s \na different issue. Theoretical arguments about Phi, though, would \nprobably best be continued on one of the other lists.\n\n\n"

Pehrson\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, sometimes 8th-tones are used as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea there is that the performers will naturally slide things \ninto \n&gt; proper place.  So yes,  the notation is a bad approximation, but \nthe \n&gt; performers will correct it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In some cases, that may not happen, but I&#39;ve certainly heard \nperformances \n&gt; where it does.  The performers have to be aware of what they&#39;re \nplaying, \n&gt; and conscientious about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a practical issue.  In the real world, many performers are \nfrightened \n&gt; even of mere quarter-tones.  It&#39;s highly contentious to write even \n&gt; 1/4-tones for orchestra.  On the other hand, most performers are \nhighly \n&gt; sensitive to tuning.  So it&#39;s a question of bridging that gap.\n&gt; \n&gt; 24 is just one step on the way to . . . 72?\n\nThat&#39;s clearly what Joseph is getting at. He loves to point out that \nonly two new deviations need to be learned -- sixth-tones and twelfth-\ntones -- and then one has very accurate and unambiguous \nrepresentations of the first 12 harmonics (and, of course, all 29 \n(per octave) of Partch&#39;s eleven-limit consonances). 72-equal notation \nand performance, though for very different purposes, is currently \ntaught and practiced at the New England Conservatory. So -- why not \npush for this next step for spectral musics in which it&#39;s even \npossible in the first place -- because of various audible harmonic-\nseries-biased effects -- to &quot;slide things into proper place&quot;? Clearly \nit&#39;s a lot less demanding than Johnny Reinhard&#39;s *cents* notation, \nwhich requires one, at least mentally, to distinguish 100, not 6, \nparts within each semitone.\n\n\n"

It is close to 8/5, even \ncloser to 13/8, and closer yet to 21/13. None of this suggests pain \nto me, nor does there seem to be any point in trying for \napproximations of algebraic numbers per se, since there seems to be \nnothing in our mechanism of hearing which picks them out. A timbre \nsynthesized to have only Fibonacci overtones would be interesting \nfrom a phi point of view, however. If we used only 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,\n21 as our partials, the critical band dissonance would have a pattern \nvery different than that of most periodic timbres.\n\n&gt; To me, the most dissonant or painful intervals are concentrated in \na \n&gt; region between a sixth-tone and a semitone, though this can vary \n&gt; somewhat as a function of register and timbre. There are similar \n&gt; bands of dissonant/painful intervals around the sharp and flat \n&gt; octave, the sharp and flat fifth, etc.\n\nI agree; the maximum of dissonance seems to me to be about a quarter \ntone. \n\n\n\n"

Both 22 and 31 not only meet, \n&gt; but exceed Hindemith&#39;s requirements by including the 11th harmonic \nas \n&gt; well.\n&gt; \n&gt; --George\n\n\n***Thanks so much, George!  Yes, I understood *your* post and Paul&#39;s \nresponse right away.  I had a little more trouble with Gene&#39;s, but \nnow, in the context of your discussion, Gene&#39;s is making sense too \n(albeit a bit abstractly...)  Thanks so much!\n\nJoseph\n\n\n\n"

Next\nweek, after three months, we&#39;ll finally look at some ET tunings and\nsee which ones offer what intervals we&#39;ve already learned. I can&#39;t\nimagine going about it backwards and teaching 17tet, 19tet, 22tet, and\nso on first - it would feel like teaching people to read first and\nthen the alphabet later. I can&#39;t figure how you&#39;d explain the\nadvantages and disadvantages of an ET without first knowing what the\ndifferent intervals *mean*.\n\nEven within the little microtonal universe there are different\nworlds....

I&#39;ve been teaching a tuning class\n&gt; since January, and we&#39;ve learned all the JI 3-limit intervals,\n&gt; 5-limit, 7-limit, 11-limit, and now we&#39;re on 13, 17, and 19. Next\n&gt; week, after three months, we&#39;ll finally look at some ET tunings and\n&gt; see which ones offer what intervals we&#39;ve already learned. I can&#39;t\n&gt; imagine going about it backwards and teaching 17tet, 19tet, 22tet, \nand\n&gt; so on first - it would feel like teaching people to read first and\n&gt; then the alphabet later. I can&#39;t figure how you&#39;d explain the\n&gt; advantages and disadvantages of an ET without first knowing what the\n&gt; different intervals *mean*.\n&gt; Even within the little microtonal universe there are different\n&gt; worlds.... To each his own. :^)\n\nFor what it&#39;s worth, my belief is that intervals mean different \nthings in different contexts, no matter how they&#39;re tuned. And no \ninterval means any more or any less than any other -- it&#39;s just that \nsome intervals and chords are harmonically *clearer* than others.\n\nWhen you get up to scales, even this clarity criterion no longer \n*necessarily* maximized by JI tuning. IMHO.\n\nWell wishes,\nPaul\n\n\n"

As it happened, simply\nsubscribing at my new address via e-mail rather than the Web interface\nseemed neatly to solve my technical problems, which might reflect my\nuse of a text-based Internet account and browser.\n\nTo start on the right foot, I&#39;d like to share a musical example\naddressing a question recently raised: the qualities of Phi as an\ninterval ratio, about 1.618 or ~833.09 cents. What you&#39;ll hear in this\nexample is an approximation in the Peppermint 24 tuning, ~832.76 cents:\n\n      &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/pmntphi1.mid&gt;\n\nThis is one of my favorite intervals, and for me belongs to what I\nwould call the family of &quot;supraminor and submajor&quot; intervals. Other\nexamples would be supraminor thirds at around 17:14 (~336.13 cents),\nwith this passage also providing an example as I&#39;ll discuss shortly;\nsubmajor thirds at around 21:17 (~365.83 cents); and submajor sixths\nat around 28:17 (~863.87 cents).\n\nTo explain the notation for my example below (for people reading on\nthe Web, much better if you can view with the original formatting,\nmaybe &quot;Expand Messages&quot; or the like), I should say a bit about\nPeppermint. Mostly it&#39;s a tuning very gratefully borrowed from Erv\nWilson and Keenan Pepper, the first of whom noted its position on his\nScale Tree, and the second of whom independently proposed it on the\nTuning list in September 2000.\n\nAs soon as I learned that the fifths were around 704.10 cents, I was\nvery excited, and indeed it&#39;s almost as if this were a custom\noptimization designed especially for me. I could write a long essay on\nthis (and have written more than one), but suffice it to say that I\nhave a passion for regular major and minor thirds around 14:11 and\n13:11 (about 417.51/289.21 cents), and supraminor and submajor thirds\naround 17:14 and 21:17. In the Wilson/Pepper temperament, all four of\nthese intervals are within 1.5 cents of the just ratios.\n\nThis very nicely fits the &quot;neo-medieval&quot; music I make based largely on\n13th-14th century Western European styles, where rather complex and\nactive thirds and sixths often resolve to stable fifths and fourths.\nAs has been discussed here, what you consider a &quot;good&quot; tuning can\noften depend on what style you&#39;re following, and my passion for\nPeppermint might be an apt example.\n\nTo get Peppermint 24, I took a basic 12-note tuning and added another\n12-note chain of fifths at the distance of about 58.680 cents, so as\nto produce some pure 7:6 minor thirds (~266.87 cents) as well as lots\nof other new intervals quite close to just ratios of 2, 3, 7, 9, 11,\nand 13.\n\nIn notating my example of the &quot;Phi sixth,&quot; I use an asterisk (*) to\nshow a note on the upper 12-note keyboard, raised by 58.680 cents or\nso. Here that becomes relevant for the next to last chord or sonority,\nas we&#39;ll see.\n\n(3/4)             (2/4)\n  1    2  +   3   + | 1   +  2   + | 1    2   | 1    2 ||\n  F#4     G4  F#4 F4  F#4 G4 F#4 F4  F#4        F#*4\n  C#4     D4  C#4 C4  C#4 D4 C#4 C4  C#4        C#*4\n  Bb3                                Bb3  G#*3  F*3\n\nMostly this passage is an example of what I call &quot;Phi drift.&quot; The\nupper voices start at the supraminor third and sixth (about 336 and\n833 cents above the lowest voice), and move in parallel fourths: first\nup to a sonority with the usual major third and sixth (around 416 and\n912 cents), then back to the supraminor third and sixth, then down to\nthe second and fifth (approximating a JI chord of 8:9:12, another of\nmy favorites), then back up to the supraminor sonority, and so forth.\n\nWhat I&#39;m going for, to use a medieval European term, is &quot;imperfect\nconsonance&quot;: a mildly unstable texture pleasant in itself, but with\nsome tension or inconclusiveness eventually leading to a resolution of\nsome kind. What I&#39;d call a Phi sixth is not &quot;dissonant&quot; but a bit\n&quot;vague&quot; or &quot;cloudy&quot; -- I once commented to Erv Wilson that it&#39;s the\nkind of interval Debussy might have used around 1900 if it had been\npart of the prevailing intonational palette. How&#39;s &quot;impressionistic&quot;?\n\nHere the eventual resolution illustrates one of the features of the\n24-note tuning: the lowest voice shifts from Bb on the lower keyboard\nto G#*, forming a wide major third and sixth with the upper voices at\naround 437.38 and 933.13 cents, with the sixth a pure 12:7, very close\nto 7:9:12. This sonority resolves in a typical medieval fashion, with\nthe major third expanding to a fifth and the major sixth to an octave.\n\nTo put things less technically, this large major third is closer in\nsize to the fifth and so can resolve to it more efficiently, and\nlikewise the large major sixth to the octave; at the same time, these\nintervals have ratios at or very close to a simple 9:7 or 12:7. For\nme, &quot;audibly just thirds with small integer ratios&quot; often means 7:6\nand 9:7, in which I find purity, efficiency, and excitement.\n\nWhat I want to do here, in discussing Phi sixths, is to put my musical\nimpressions in a bit of context, as I hope the musical example itself\nmight help to do. Specifically, since I regard thirds and sixths as\nactive or &quot;imperfect&quot; consonances, a Phi sixth seems a natural part of\nthe landscape.\n\nHere I might quickly comment that in addition to these supraminor or\nPhi sixths, actually augmented fifths (e.g. Bb-F# in this example),\nPeppermint 24 also has some close approximations of the 13:8 or\n&quot;harmonic&quot; neutral sixth at about 842.30 cents, or about 1.77 cents\nlarger than the just ratio of ~840.53 cents. This is realized as a\nregular minor sixth plus the 59-cent interval between the keyboards,\nfor example A-F*.\n\nOne of the consequences of my association with George Secor is that\nI&#39;ve acquired a taste for 13:8 to complement my predilection for the\nnearby Phi sixth. In Peppermint 24, both sizes of sixths are\navailable. By the way, I would like warmly to thank George for lending\na lot of the creative impetus leading to and enriching my adventure\nwith this 24-note system, and to note that his HTT-29 not only\nprovided an inspiring precedent, but offers a near-just system with\ngreater overall accuracy for most of the ratios supported by\nPeppermint, not to mention a wider range of intervals.\n\nThese remarks as to the Phi sixth and Peppermint might give some idea\nof what is for me a &quot;usual&quot; musical style or tuning system, possibly\nfilling in a bit of perspective for my next intended post on some\ndelighted first impressions of what I would call a less conventional\nand very beautiful tuning: 14-tET.\n\nBy the way, here&#39;s a link to a Scala file for Peppermint 24:\n\n       &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/peprmint.scl&gt;\n\nand here&#39;s one to Scala files for George Secor&#39;s HTT-29, HTT-17, and\nthe superset of HTT-41:\n\n       &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/messages/7574&gt;\n\nAgain, thanks to the many people who have made this forum possible.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n"

There&#39;s lots of beating\n&gt; in that music. . . . but I find it very pleasurable to listen to. \n&gt; The moments when there isn&#39;t beating are actually quite flat and\n&gt; boring,  but as soon as the ole&#39; glissando moves along and beats are\n&gt; flying out at me. . . it sound great.  No pain there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even music with big clusters. . . I don&#39;t find it &quot;painful&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; When music causes me to have a &quot;headache&quot; or to feel pain, it&#39;s\n&gt; usually &quot;cognitive&quot; pain, as opposed to &quot;physical&quot; pain.  In other\n&gt; words,  not due to the sensation of individual intervals,  but\n&gt; rather, to not being able to follow the music, in terms of form or\n&gt; harmonic rhythm, or whatever. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nIn my postings, I refered to a sensory pain, precisely like that when \none eats chili peppers.  People have strong and widely varying opinions \non the desireability and proportion of chili peppers in their diet, \nlikewise on dissonance in music.   I happen to be as disastisfied with \nbland food as with bland harmony.  (And &quot;bland&quot; is itself contextual -- \na 12-(or 13- or 14- ...) tone piece with an undifferentiated surface* \nmay be just as bland as  a chorale composed only of the simplest triads).\n\nI have no doubt that the &quot;cognitive&quot; dimension is also important, and in \nthe right settings, perhaps more important.  One feature in some early \nworks of Satie is a reversal in the consonance/dissonance classification \nof vertical intervals; thirds, fifths, sixths occur on weak beats and \n&quot;resolve&quot; into fourths, seconds and sevenths.  Whether through \ncompositional skill or sleight-of-hand, he appeals to cognition over \nsensation and manages to overide the usual consonance/dissonance \nregime.  But I have to say this with a caveat -- part of my enjoyment of \nSatie is recognizing that he is subverting the usual order of things,  \nbut in my recognition of that subversion, am I not simultaneously \nreifying that usual order?\n\nAlvin Lucier was my dissertation advisor, so your description strikes me \nas right on -- but isn&#39;t it the contrast to the flatness of the unisons \nthat makes the beating so vivid?\n\nDJW\n\n* This is more an observation for the SpecMus list than for here, but \ncould it be that the greatest failing in a lot of 12-tone music is its \negodic character: any random sample is going  to sound statistically \npretty much like any other sample;  in contrast, in a work of La Monte \nYoung or Alvin Lucier, the focus on the most local scale of activity \nforces the listener to locate contrasts more readily.  So the paradox of \nthe working containing everything becoming more boring with longer \nexposure, while the work with nearly nothing just gets more interesting \nall the time!\n\n\n"

I would start \nwith the music itself, and the intonations music has historically \ndemanded.  I made a pedagogical proposal several years ago that \nmusicians should learn, in parallel with historical/theoretical and \npractical studies, to play in the most important tuning regimes of the \nrepertoire relevant to the individual musician.  Thus, a western \nclassical musician should know how to perform in some subset of the \nfollowing: pythagorean, meantone, some &quot;general&quot; well-temperament, and \n12-tet.  Simultaneously, they should learn, from singing if possible,  \nJI intervals through 7 or 11, and to tune to cent deviations from 12tet \npitches.\n\n&gt; JI intervals certainly have their own sort of pleasure;  but --- to\n&gt; bring up a possible point amongst Mclaren&#39;s endless invectives, what\n&gt; evidence is there that JI intervals are &quot;preferred&quot; by people\n&gt; outside of Western-Europe/USA circles, and those so influenced?\n\n\nI think I speak for all of us who use JI intervals as a point of \nreference, that that point of reference is always qualified by the \nassumption of harmonic timbres etc..  In a previous posting, I have \nrecording my disagreement with the western bias of some research.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If Thai music is based on 5-TET,  did a whole population just &quot;screw\n&gt; up&quot; or something?  Or African kalimbas. . . I&#39;m pretty sure they\n&gt; aren&#39;t in 5-limit JI . . . were they a &quot;mistake&quot;? \n&gt;\nThai does use 7-tet, but  it&#39;s no screw up. Rather, it&#39;s a pragmatic \ncompromise allowing the Thai to transpose their unequal 5-tone scale to \nseven degrees of a fixed tuning.\n\nI haven&#39;t ever heard of any kalimbas in 5-limit JI --  are you certain  \nof  a reference for this?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure. . . most cultures have something like a 5th,  something like a\n&gt; 4th, various kinds of 3rds,  etc.  But &quot;something like&quot; is a long\n&gt; way from &quot;3/2&quot; or &quot;6/5&quot;.\n\n\nHere&#39;s a short answer: Consider the fact that the apparatus we use for \nputting music into our brains is largely the same as that we use for \nputting (audible) speech into our brains.   The perception  of speech \ndepends in part upon analysing signals with exact harmonic spectra, and \napparently the  lower end of  the spectra where relationships can be \nchacterized by ratios of small whole numbers. This is not the place for \na debate on the origins of music, but it is probably safe to say that \nvocal utterances are one of the most important origins, and their \nharmonic character is not subject to debate.\n\nYes, there are music cultures where the intervals appear to deviate \nstrongly from a JI model, but a second or third look, as in the Thai \nexample above, may show the rational heart of an irrational surface.   \nThe Thai  may well  have taken  a vocal pythagorean or  just pentatonic \nscale and , through years if not centuries of trial-and-error, made it \nfit into the 7-tet environment.   And when an irrational tuning like \n7-tet is impressed onto an ensemble of idiophones and gongs, then the \ntolerance for a deviation from a JI tuning is greatly increased.  (I \nhave a studio full of gamelan instruments to back me up on this -- \nhttp://www.world-edition.com/world/malvear/pages/books/generatio/wolf.htm \n-- each individual gong in my bonang or each key on a metallophone has a \nnoticeably different spectrum.)  &quot;Something like&quot; is indeed very much a \npart of our musical lives, which we live as if we still navigated via \nflat earth coordinates.  (I happen to like this situation...)\n\n&gt; Again . . I have nothing against JI (and having been writing some\n&gt; stuff in it recently) . . .  but what is the un-biased evidence that\n&gt; as Ben Johnston put it &quot;Just Intonation is the best intonation&quot;.\n&gt;\nThe quote is due Lou Harrison (Music Primer, page 4).\n\nDJW\n\n"

It only took a week.\n\nNow, I bring up the old conundrum--theory vs. practice, and why we can&#39;t \nincorporate both into one list, etc. Let me be brief and say that the math \nhas always dominated the Tuning List, and MMM was a nice place to come to get \nthat &#39;tempered&#39; by aesthetic, compositional, and hardware/software concerns.\n\nI don&#39;t know the answer here folks. Just thought I&#39;d risk raising my alarm and \nsee if anyone else felt the same. \n\nI&#39;d almost propose the insane (or is it--it might be a wonderful change) \nsolution of a composition-only list (I thought MMM would be that candidate), \na theory-only list, and a hardware/software discussion list.\n\nWhat I&#39;d like to see is people discussing actual microtonal works, and theory \nin that case would only be relevant where it concerned the work(s) under \ndiscussion. Any general discussions of microtonal aesthetics would also be \nconsidered relevant. Again, I admit a problem with drawing the line, but I \nwoud say as soon as the terminology of &#39;ennalimmeal&#39;, &#39;monzos&#39; and &#39;vals&#39; \npops up on MMM, I feel MMM is no longer MMM. \n\nFor instance, a subject thread might be Kyle Gann&#39;s &#39;Custer&#39;s Ghost&#39; and it&#39;s \nuse of &#39;just dissonance&#39;, and how he used that resource in that particular \nwork, etc., and the effect of that on the listener.\n\nFor now let me say that I don&#39;t take much interest in many of the recent \ntrends and threads of MMM, which are indistinguishable from the standard \ntuning list. I think those topics are fine and interesting to some, but \nshould stay over there, IMO, where they are more on topic, and not here, \nwhere they are much less so.\n\nSomething funny is happening to the community--an internal rupture of some \nsort. Carl leaving; Jon saying he won&#39;t post anything but announcements; \nflaming and ego battles; -- all these things are making a lot of people who \nshould be friends very bitter (it seems) at each other. It&#39;s sad--the tuning \ncommunity right before Peter Wakefield Sault was at a nice point, right after \nhe came and left, he left a nasty tone and division in his wake, it seems. \nAnd now McLaren has stirred up a nasty vibe at metatuning as well. At least \nthat&#39;s how I recall the history of how I&#39;ve felt about the community.\n\nNow I&#39;ll duck under a boulder while the bullets fly at me and across me, and \nthe &#39;camps&#39; split into two or three. (It would be great to see a potentially \nsensitive post receive a measured response where this didn&#39;t happen !!!! \nLet&#39;s try it...)\n\nBest,\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

The West has very little idea what a true 5:4 sounds \nlike, compared to India. This is easy to hear if you&#39;ve trained your \near and got a good assortment of recordings to check out.\n\n&gt; If Thai music is based on 5-TET,\n\n7, actually.\n\n&gt; did a whole population just &quot;screw \n&gt; up&quot; or something? \n\nAbsolutely not. This is what I was getting at in my reply to Kyle.\n\n&gt;(ACtually Mclaren claims, I don&#39;t know \n&gt; if he&#39;s wrong, that even those experiments were bogus . . . )\n\nIf you check up on his claims, very few turn out to be true . . . \nparticularly when he&#39;s &quot;quoting&quot; people or research.\n\n&gt; Again . . I have nothing against JI (and having been writing some \n&gt; stuff in it recently) . . .  but what is the un-biased evidence \nthat \n&gt; as Ben Johnston put it &quot;Just Intonation is the best intonation&quot;.\n\nI think it&#39;s not the best intonation for most musics.\n\n\n"

Or African kalimbas. . . I&#39;m pretty sure they \n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t in 5-limit JI . . . were they a &quot;mistake&quot;?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, having first read about Thai music being in 5tet\n\n7-equal.\n\n&gt; in Henry\n&gt; Cowell&#39;s book,\n\nMaybe Cowell got it wrong -- don&#39;t have his book.\n\n&gt; I later ran across some of the relevant\n&gt; ethnomusicological research on this supposition. Thai musicians, it\n&gt; appears, do talk about their scale as consisting of five\n\nseven\n\n&gt; equal steps.\n&gt; But when recorded and interviewed by ethnomusicologists, they would\n&gt; play the pitches a little lower or higher, and say, &quot;Well, we *call*\n&gt; them equal, but of course we play this one up here and this one down\n&gt; here....&quot; A Thai music expert told me that the whole [equal] thing \nwas a\n&gt; terminological fallacy, as though we were to claim that the white \nkeys\n&gt; on the piano were all equally spaced.\n\nThere&#39;s an important disctinction here. Thai music is pentatonic and \n*modulates* around several of the seven keys, and the pentatonic \nmodal forms are considered the *same* no matter which pitch level \nthey occur on. This is utterly different than the white keys on the \npiano. No one considers major, dorian, phryian . . . locrian all to \nbe different tunings of the same mode. It&#39;s like night and day.\n\n&gt; Funny how widespread the\n&gt; assumption became, though.\n\nHave you read the New Grove article on Thai music?\n\n\n"

Actually, I simulated this within a computer by\nmeans of a discrete numerical integrator.  I interpreted the\nparticles&#39; positions as pitch, and their velocities as rhythm; roughly\nspeaking, the faster a particle moves, the more frequently its pitch\nis heard.  Since the simulated space is continuous, or at least nearly\nso, many wonderful microtones emerge.  Perhaps a warning is in order:\nthis piece contains dissonance, but exotic dissonance which ultimately\nrelaxes onto consonance, for I derived my potential fields from the\nso-called dissonance curves first introduced by Kameoka and Kuriyagawa\nin 1969, and which I first studied through William Sethares&#39;s 1998\nbook.  Thus, the particles &quot;swirl&quot; into locally consonant attractors.\nFor additional details, please follow the link above.\n\nAdditionally, for those of you near Cincinnati (USA), &quot;Ripples&quot; will\nbe performed at the &quot;Pi: Chaos vs. Control&quot; event at the Mockbee on 28\nMay 2004.  For more information, please visit:\n\n  http://home.cinci.rr.com/chrisherrick/Pi.htm\n\nSincerely,\n  Carl McTague\n\n\n"

I would \nstart \n&gt; with the music itself, and the intonations music has historically \n&gt; demanded.  I made a pedagogical proposal several years ago \nthat \n&gt; musicians should learn, in parallel with historical/theoretical \nand \n&gt; practical studies, to play in the most important tuning regimes \nof the \n&gt; repertoire relevant to the individual musician.  Thus, a western \n&gt; classical musician should know how to perform in some \nsubset of the \n&gt; following: pythagorean, meantone, some &quot;general&quot; \nwell-temperament, and \n&gt; 12-tet.  Simultaneously, they should learn, from singing if \npossible,  \n&gt; JI intervals through 7 or 11, and to tune to cent deviations from \n12tet \n&gt; pitches.\n&gt; \n\nThis sounds wonderful . . .I was just talking about the situation of \nan &quot;intro to microtonality&quot; class for probably mainly composers.  \nThough the above wouldn&#39;t hurt them either.  \n\n\n&gt; &gt; JI intervals certainly have their own sort of pleasure;  but --- to\n&gt; &gt; bring up a possible point amongst Mclaren&#39;s endless \ninvectives, what\n&gt; &gt; evidence is there that JI intervals are &quot;preferred&quot; by people\n&gt; &gt; outside of Western-Europe/USA circles, and those so \ninfluenced?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think I speak for all of us who use JI intervals as a point of \n&gt; reference, that that point of reference is always qualified by the \n&gt; assumption of harmonic timbres etc..  In a previous posting, I \nhave \n&gt; recording my disagreement with the western bias of some \nresearch.\n&gt; \n\nBut surely there is music out there in harmonic timbres that isn&#39;t \nJust Tuned?\n\nLike those African pan-pipe ensembles,  where the &quot;harmony&quot; \nseems to be (to my untrained ears) magnificent clusters, thick \nwads of sound.  \n\nI sometimes think there are perhaps a number of basic \nsonic-cognitive  &quot;ideas&quot;,  any number of which a culture might \nfocus on (unconsciously) to develop their music(s).   I don&#39;t think \nthese &quot;ideas&quot; take the form of &quot;rules&quot;  ,  i.e.,  I don&#39;t think there is \na hard-wired rule in our brains that says &quot;Avoid beating at all \ncosts.&quot;   Rather,  what&#39;s hard-wired is, &quot;Hey, this is beating.  Here  \nare some intervals that produce it, in combination with certain \ntimbres.   Here are some intervals that don&#39;t.&quot;   (I&#39;m simplifying \nmassively of course).   Some cultures or musics might want to \nemphasize Beating (like gamelan metallophones with their \nbeating timbres), and de-emphasize  Just Intervals (thus using \n&quot;sorta&quot; 5ths and 4ths and 3rds).  Others,  might do the reverse.\n\nBut crucial here is the fact that something like &quot;beating&quot; isn&#39;t \nuniversally &quot;to be avoided&quot;.  It&#39;s just there,  certain circumstances \ncan make it happen,  and whether you want it happening or not  \ndepends on a whole number of factors.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If Thai music is based on 5-TET,  did a whole population just \n&quot;screw\n&gt; &gt; up&quot; or something?  Or African kalimbas. . . I&#39;m pretty sure they\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t in 5-limit JI . . . were they a &quot;mistake&quot;? \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Thai does use 7-tet, but  it&#39;s no screw up. Rather, it&#39;s a \npragmatic \n&gt; compromise allowing the Thai to transpose their unequal \n5-tone scale to \n&gt; seven degrees of a fixed tuning.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t ever heard of any kalimbas in 5-limit JI --  are you \ncertain  \n&gt; of  a reference for this?\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re mireading me. . . I Was saying,  there aren&#39;t any (that I \nknow of) . . . and therefore,  this was another example of a culture \nthat seems not to care too much about Just Intonation.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sure. . . most cultures have something like a 5th,  something \nlike a\n&gt; &gt; 4th, various kinds of 3rds,  etc.  But &quot;something like&quot; is a long\n&gt; &gt; way from &quot;3/2&quot; or &quot;6/5&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Something like&quot; is indeed very much a \n&gt; part of our musical lives, which we live as if we still navigated \nvia \n&gt; flat earth coordinates.  (I happen to like this situation...)\n&gt;\n\nI as well.  Amen.  The &quot;fuzziness&quot; of these things,  which \npresumably helps to lead to all of the terrific variety of the world&#39;s \nmusics,  is to be celebrated.\n \n&gt; &gt; Again . . I have nothing against JI (and having been writing \nsome\n&gt; &gt; stuff in it recently) . . .  but what is the un-biased evidence that\n&gt; &gt; as Ben Johnston put it &quot;Just Intonation is the best intonation&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; The quote is due Lou Harrison (Music Primer, page 4).\n&gt; \n\nOops.  Sorry.\n\n\n\n"

I know I&#39;m not alone in thinking that MMM \nhas gone a bit too much the way of ATL *already*, however.\n\nFar too little talk on aesthetics is done here, while we&#39;re at it. Concert and \nCD reviews, educational discussions of essential recordings and microtonal \nrepertoire, discussions of compositional technique (duh!!!), how form, \nrhythm, and affect might be effected by the technical choice of scale, etc.\n\nAt least to me and many others, this is where the meat of the discussion \n*ought* be, and I long for a group where this is reality !!!\n\nThat being said, no thread is ever going to be interesting to all members \nequally, or even applicable (Mac OS-X threads mean nothing to a Linux geek \nlike me).

Actually, I simulated this within a computer by\n&gt; means of a discrete numerical integrator.  I interpreted the\n&gt; particles&#39; positions as pitch, and their velocities as rhythm; \nroughly\n&gt; speaking, the faster a particle moves, the more frequently its pitch\n&gt; is heard.  Since the simulated space is continuous, or at least \nnearly\n&gt; so, many wonderful microtones emerge.  Perhaps a warning is in \norder:\n&gt; this piece contains dissonance, but exotic dissonance which \nultimately\n&gt; relaxes onto consonance, for I derived my potential fields from the\n&gt; so-called dissonance curves first introduced by Kameoka and \nKuriyagawa\n&gt; in 1969, and which I first studied through William Sethares&#39;s 1998\n&gt; book.  Thus, the particles &quot;swirl&quot; into locally consonant \nattractors.\n&gt; For additional details, please follow the link above.\n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, for those of you near Cincinnati (USA), &quot;Ripples&quot; will\n&gt; be performed at the &quot;Pi: Chaos vs. Control&quot; event at the Mockbee on \n28\n&gt; May 2004.  For more information, please visit:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://home.cinci.rr.com/chrisherrick/Pi.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;   Carl McTague\n\n\n***I find this quite interesting and it&#39;s reminiscent somewhat of \nXenakis&#39; electronic works, which is not surprising, since his \nstatistical methods seem somewhat related to yours....  I think \npossibly the timbre is a bit better defined in this than in the \nXenakis works, but he likes a very &quot;wet&quot; post-production it seems...\n\nJoseph Pehrson\n\n\n\n"

How do they react to the \nabsence of anything resembling a whole tone?\n\n3)  What, from your experience, is 15 *good* at?  How does it affect form, rhythm, \naffect? (This is, of course, the only thing that people mean by the &quot;mood&quot; of a scale.)\n\n&gt; At least to me and many others, this is where the meat of the discussion \n&gt; *ought* be, and I long for a group where this is reality !!!\n\nAmen.\n\n&gt; Best,\n\nJacob\n\n\n"

A thirdtone system in 14\nnotes rather than 17 with three varieties of thirds or sixths; an\noutstanding major third to which Brian McLaren rightly called my\nattention; and fine 86-cent semitones of the kind that a string player\n(bowed European violin or plucked Japanese koto) could love even\nwithout my specifically medievalist inclinations regarding vertical\ncadences and the like.\n\nWith 14-tET, as people might guess, I was confronted with a\nprecompositional or pre-improvisational &quot;performance practice&quot;:\nchoosing a timbre to make those 8/14 octave fifths (~686 cents) and\n6/14 octave fourths (~514 cents) the &quot;perfect concords&quot; which my\nmusical style calls for.\n\nMy quick solution that first night (Monday) was a preset timbre on the\nYahama TX-802 called &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; (A56); I also tried a Marimba voice\nfor more of a gamelan texture, which could be neat with a beautiful\npelog that 14-tET supports (more below). This let me start my\nexploration at a point where things were &quot;smooth enough for the\nmoment,&quot; although I might look forward to play around in quest of a\nbit more smoothness and resonance.\n\nMy slightly more customized but still rather &quot;crude&quot; solution the next\nday was to take a timbre I had set up for 13-tET, and adjust the\nsettings of partials for the 14-tET fifth or twelfth (a ratio of about\n2.97 for the twelfth in comparison to 3.00 for a pure twelfth).\n\nThis got to things to a nice point: a certain resonant quality to\nthose fifths and twelfths, maybe especially when the octave helped out\nin a complete trine (a 2:3:4 sonority, with the fifth below the\nfourth, or 0-8-14 steps in 14-tET). However, even with the &quot;off the\nshelf&quot; Puff Pipes the first night, things were quite tolerable: while\ncomparisons are difficult, I&#39;d say it was possibly comparable to\nmeantone fifths in a bright timbre.\n\nOf course, getting the stable concords is just the beginning of the\nstory, a kind of prerequisite preparation: there are all those juicy\nimperfect concords, and I was ready to try them!\n\nBy the way, Aaron and others, the timbre factor is the one reason that\nI&#39;m using ASCII notation rather than MIDI files, specifying the notes\nand cautioning that this is highly timbre-sensitive. A tape or CD or\naudio soundfile, of course, is the best documentation.\n\nTo start out, one of the first things I did in 14-tET, not\nunpredictably, was to try this cadence:\n\n           21  22\n           13  14\n           2   0\n\nIt was beautiful, and very familiar: a major sixth (11 steps, 2-13)\nexpanding to an octave (0-14), and a major tenth (19 steps, 2-21)\nexpanding to a twelfth (0-22). My reaction: &quot;This could be Notre Dame\nCathedral in 1350&quot;: it sounds fitting, classic, and _right_!\n\nBy this way, this style of notation takes the lowest note of the\nresolving interval or chord as step &quot;0&quot;; it shows the pitches in a\nstraightforward manner, at least, and spares the reader some\nentanglement in my curious keyboard mapping.\n\nWell, it seems that a distinctly &quot;xenharmonic&quot; temperament like 14-tET\ncan tune some basic intervals harmoniously (with a conducive timbre,\nof course, a qualification applying to many musical situations to one\ndegree or another) and bring off a standard cadence. While the\n428-cent major third is within a &quot;standard&quot; range, and quite superb,\nthe 942-cent major sixth might be considered a bit wider than the run\nof the mill -- but the intervals fit together flawlessly.\n\nNow for an experiment I&#39;ve been waiting to try, something I guess\nwill delight me, but wonder just how it will sound:\n\n        10   8\n         7   8\n         2   0\n        -1   0\n\nThis is a gorgeous &quot;minor seventh quad,&quot; as I call it, with the outer\nminor seventh (11 steps) contracting to a stable fifth, and those\nminor thirds (3 steps) contracting to unisons, while the middle major\nthird (5 steps) expands to a fifth: it&#39;s warm, suave, and sweet, just\nas in a JI tuning like my Sesquisexta (where that seventh sonority is\na pure 12:14:18:21), or a more conventional temperament like HTT-29,\nPeppermint, or 17-WT.\n\nHow cozy and familiar and homelike this feels -- that&#39;s my main\nartistic judgment. It is an enjoyment of shear beauty joined to\nanalytical wonder: this hospitable sonority has as its minor seventh\nthe same 11-step interval that provided the charmingly expansive major\nsixth of my previous example. As I had guessed, that 943-cent interval\ncould most happily fit both roles. In a JI system like Sesquisexta,\nwe&#39;d use two separate intervals: a 12:7 major sixth around 933 cents,\nand a 7:4 minor seventh around 969 cents, with values near these in\ntempered systems seeking closely to emulate this kind of JI.\n\nA bit of further experimenting confirmed that the 11-step interval\ntends to take on the color of either a major sixth or minor seventh,\ndepending on the intervals with which it is associated in a given\nsonority or progression. I&#39;ll give more examples in my next report.\n\nIn the meantone -- or meantime, a &quot;slip of the keyboard&quot; I&#39;ve made an\nidiom of sorts -- thank you, Aaron, for your welcome, and I&#39;m looking\nforward to lots of compositional/improvisational dialogue.\n\nOh, yes -- here&#39;s that pelog, as promised, actually two variations:\n\n                  0   1      6     8   9       14\n                  0  86     514   686 771     1200\n                    1    5      2    1     5\n                    86  429    171   86   429\n\n                                or\n\n                  0   1    3       8   9       14\n                  0  86   257     686 771     1200\n                    1   2      5     1     5\n                    86 171    429    86   429\n\nIn conventional notation we might write E-F-A-B-C-E and E-F-G-B-C-E,\nrespectively, and that happens to be my keyboard mapping; they&#39;re\nbeautiful scales.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n\n"

That&#39;s basically correct.  I simulated twenty equally-spaced\npoint masses beginning at rest, and rolling along each of four\nSethares-like dissonance curves.  The integrator has a velocity term,\nas well as a first-order friction term.  But there are no collisions:\nall the particles&#39; paths are computed independently.  (It might be\nvery interesting to do something more sophisticated.)  To be as\nconcrete as possible, here is the very naive integrator code, written\nin the programming language Haskell:\n\ng p m dx dt fc v x = (v&#39;,x&#39;)\n    where dp = (p x - p (x+dx))/dx -- approx. change in potential\n\t  f = dp  - fc * v -- the force exerted by the field and friction\n\t  a = f / m -- Newton&#39;s law (f=ma)\n\t  v&#39; = v + a * dt -- approx. velocity in dt seconds\n\t  x&#39; = x + v * dt + (v&#39;-v)*dt/2 -- approx. position in dt seconds\n\nAs is typical for such integrators, the simulation thus relies on\nconstants dt and dx, as well as the mass m of the particle, and the\nfriction constant fc.  The function p is the potential field, in this\ncase the dissonance curve.  The constant dt determines the time\nresolution of the simulation.  Think of the simulation&#39;s output as\nstill frames obtained from a strobe light that flashes every dt\nseconds, except that at each frame, the simulation also provides the\nparticles&#39; velocities.\n\nFor each movement, I ran the system for two-hundred frames, and\ninterpreted the particles&#39; positions as pitch.  But rather than using\nthe literal time of the frames to determine rhythm---this would be\nboring, just twenty simultaneous notes every dt seconds---I used the\nparticles&#39; velocities: I set the duration of each note to k/(c+|v|),\nwhere k and c are positive constants which I chose by ear.  This is\nnot an altogether artificial approach, for in this way, the faster a\nparticle moves, the more rapid are its notes.  However, an additional\nconsequence of this scheme is that, since I sampled only two-hundred\nframes, the quickly moving particles exhaust their frames sooner, and\ndrop out of the piece.\n\nIt is perhaps natural to wonder to what extent this rhythmic scheme\naffects the perceived dynamics of the system.  After some\ninvestigation, I discovered that it is, in fact, very significant.\nThe particles which dominate the opening of the piece are those with\nthe greatest initial acceleration, and these are the particles whose\ninitial positions lie along the dissonance curve&#39;s sharpest slopes.\nConversely, the particles which become dominant only toward the end of\nthe piece are those which initially accelerate slowly, for instance\nthose close to the minima corresponding to Just intervals, but also\nthose close to maxima, where dissonance is greatest!  The latter tend\nto begin slowly, but then accelerate dramatically and vanish, while\nthe former remain relatively slow, and are active until the end of the\npiece.\n\nI hope this response was not unnecessarily technical.  I&#39;ve also\ncopied this message to the Alternative Tuning list, in case it is a\nmore appropriate forum, and in case any of its subscribers would find\nthis interesting.\n\nCarl\n\n&gt; If I understand correctly, you&#39;ve taken those Sethares dissonance\n&gt; curves, and essentially dropped some balls into them and we&#39;re\n&gt; hearing them bouncing around. . . . yes?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/ripples\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; studied through William Sethares&#39;s 1998 book. Thus, the particles\n&gt;&gt; &quot;swirl&quot; into locally consonant attractors.\n&gt;\n&gt; One question: when you described this piece to me a while ago, it\n&gt; sounded like the &quot;consonant&quot; balls stopped bouncing around much\n&gt; sooner that the dissonant ones.\n&gt;\n&gt; In which case, you&#39;ve actually got a piece which shows off the\n&gt; dissonant areas of the Sethares curves.\n&gt;\n&gt; But perhaps I&#39;m way off.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, it sounds wicked.\n&gt;\n&gt; C Bailey\n\n\n"

The first feature, and the one that applies to Margo&#39;s \nscales, is the division of the three-tone sub-group into an \napproximately  2:1 proportion.  If the smaller interval is on the \nbottom, it&#39;s degung, if it&#39;s on the top, it&#39;s sorog  (&quot;sorog&quot; means \nsubstitute, and some gamelan degung have extra, replaceable sorog keys, \nso that the players can modulate into sorog during a performance).  The \nsecond feature of the degung/sorog is that they can be heard as a \nslendro with some altered tones.  I think this applies less well here as \nthe fifths are narrow, but, and strictly off the top of my head, it \nmight work if you built a slendro out of  28tet, e.g. 0-5-11-17-22-28 or \n0-5-10-17-22-28.\n\nDJW\n\n\n\n"

We can follow this up with\n&gt; discussions of compositional technique in such pieces.\n\nI&#39;m very inexperienced and unknowledgeable about any corpus of 15-tet works. I \nknow Blackwood has some guitar music, etc.\n\nI confess I was unimpressed with it at the time.....I tend to like JI or JI \nlike temperaments best, but have heard stunning stuff in tunings that had \nnothing to do with approximating JI. 15-tet, to me, strikes me as \nuninteresting *precisely* because it&#39;s in the middle of those worlds (maybe \nthat&#39;s why it&#39;s interesting--like the math professor asking &#39;what&#39;s the first \nuninteresting number&#39;, which makes it interesting--thus there are no \nuninteresting numbers (or tunings))\n\nMaybe *you* could lead this particular 15-tet discussion? Tell us what turns \n*you* on and why....pump some passion into these discussion!\n\n&gt; 2) What are your successes/failures in getting average musicians to hear\n&gt; and play the intervals found within 15 (which I find myself categorizing as\n&gt; [1/1 16/15 12/11 8/ 7 6/5 5/4 21/16 11/8] plus their octave-inversions)?\n&gt; How do they react to the absence of anything resembling a whole tone?\n\nGeez, I never talk microtonality with any fellow musicians (except my &#39;Divide \nby Pi&#39; partner, Andy) in the real world--mostly cyberspace. So I never tested \nanyone with 15-tet. Mostly because I never used it myself. It wasn&#39;t the \nfirst tuning to jump out at me of all the N-tets. or JI schemes\n\n&gt; 3)  What, from your experience, is 15 *good* at?  How does it affect form,\n&gt; rhythm, affect? (This is, of course, the only thing that people mean by the\n&gt; &quot;mood&quot; of a scale.)\n\nJacob, let me hold up a mirror (I like this discussion). Since you are seduced \nby 15-tet, start out by telling us why you are....do you have any mp3/MIDI \nexamples, if not compositions, you would share with us to relate particular \ninstances that illustrated your seduction?\n\nBest,\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

I&#39;ve read some of Xenakis&#39;s\n&gt; writings, and have heard some of his orchestral works, but am somewhat\n&gt; ashamed to admit that I have yet to investigate most of his electronic\n&gt; output.  Can you recommend any recordings?\n\nCarl,\n\nI found your piece quite interesting and strangely beautiful to listen to. \nAnd, Joseph beat me to it: I was thinking of posting the same impression--in \ntechnique and sonic texture it was *very* Xenakis to me!!!\n\nMy favorite piece of electronic music of Xenakis, and one of my favorite \nelectronic works, period, is the &#39;Legend D&#39;er&#39;. It is almost frightening at \ntimes, but always gorgeous with an incredibly, almost painfully rich level of \ndetail at its climax, wonderful on a great stereo with a rich stereo image, \nbut never falling into complete chaos--as if Xenakis stretches our ability to \ndigest his sonic landscape without ever letting us be lost into concluding it \nis too complex as to be white noise.\n\nBest,\nAaron.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;   Carl\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Apr 30, 2004 at 03:04:42AM -0000, Joseph Pehrson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ***I find this quite interesting and it&#39;s reminiscent somewhat of\n&gt; &gt; Xenakis&#39; electronic works, which is not surprising, since his\n&gt; &gt; statistical methods seem somewhat related to yours....  I think\n&gt; &gt; possibly the timbre is a bit better defined in this than in the\n&gt; &gt; Xenakis works, but he likes a very &quot;wet&quot; post-production it seems...\n\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Here, I&#39;d prefer to stick what I&#39;ve done -- or, at least, am\nabout to try in a tuning with which I&#39;m at least a little acquainted.\n\nBy the way, my decision at present to provide ASCII notation rather\nthan sound files for my examples in 14-tET is only because of my\ntechnical situation. While I can use Scala to produce MIDI files\nby coding an ASCII text file with commands for things like note\nnumbers in a given scale and duration, and then use the &quot;example&quot;\ncommand in Scala to generate a MIDI file and proofread the output with\na utility rendering an ASCII &quot;translation&quot; plus a GNU Emacs Calc\nroutine to translate pitchbend messages into cents, the system I&#39;m\nusing doesn&#39;t have any sound card or the like. With a timbre-sensitive\ntuning like 14-tET as applied to a neo-medieval style with fifths and\nfourths as perfect concords, I&#39;d prefer not to post something in a\nregistration that I haven&#39;t heard.\n\nObviously I&#39;d much prefer to put the sound itself out there, with the\nnotation as a supplement for those who might want it rather than a\nmuch inferior substitute (hearing my synthesizer timbre might also\nsaying something about how much beating I&#39;m willing to take in stride\nor what my notion of &quot;reasonably smooth concord&quot; is).\n\nThis has meant making a cassette recording, and sending it out to\nsomeone helpful who can translate it into a sound file -- with very\nhigh artistry in the case of someone like Jacky Ligon.\n\nAnyway, in dealing with this situation at the moment, I can at least\nstick on MMM to discussing tunings that I&#39;ve actually used -- adding,\nin the case of 15-tET, that composers such as Easley Blackwood and\nBrian McLaren have used it and recorded pieces in it.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

I \n&gt; know Blackwood has some guitar music, etc.\n\nI fear there is no corpus...\n\n&gt; I confess I was unimpressed with it at the time.....I tend to like JI or JI \n&gt; like temperaments best, but have heard stunning stuff in tunings that had \n&gt; nothing to do with approximating JI. 15-tet, to me, strikes me as \n&gt; uninteresting *precisely* because it&#39;s in the middle of those worlds (maybe \n&gt; that&#39;s why it&#39;s interesting--like the math professor asking &#39;what&#39;s the first \n&gt; uninteresting number&#39;, which makes it interesting--thus there are no \n&gt; uninteresting numbers (or tunings))\n\nIf you&#39;re more of the JI type, try the just tuning I mentioned below.  Oooooh, and I just \ntried a mode of 31 equal (every other note plus one little skip) and it is quite nifty!\n\n&gt; Maybe *you* could lead this particular 15-tet discussion? Tell us what turns \n&gt; *you* on and why....pump some passion into these discussion!\n\nHmmm.  My experience was with banging on a keyboard with a bright-sounding \npiano patch.  My setup prefers systems with average step size close to 12 because it \nstretches samples horribly at the extremes.  To my delight I could get a lovely \nharmonic 11th chord (my fascination with which I owe to Prent).\n\n&gt; Jacob, let me hold up a mirror (I like this discussion). Since you are seduced \n&gt; by 15-tet, start out by telling us why you are....do you have any mp3/MIDI \n&gt; examples, if not compositions, you would share with us to relate particular \n&gt; instances that illustrated your seduction?\n\nhttp://brown-1173.brown.rice.edu/~jb/3.3.mp3\n\nHere lies a &quot;hyperimprovisation&quot; (i.e. sped up) that is far from perfect, although I hope \nto flesh it out into a formal piece some time.  Most of the fun harmony comes from \nplaying parallel intervals; these are the most sensible progressions I can make with a \nnormal keyboard so far.\n\n\n"

The latter choice may involve\nyou in the hexidecimal temperament, with 36/35 and 135/128 as commas;\nthe former choice has 256/243 in place of 135/128, and may involve you\nwith the blackwood temperament, with commas 28/27 and 49/48, and\ninstead of 16 you might be comparing to 15. For this, you might want\nto flatten octaves; for the other, sharpen them. \n\nThe point being that theory is not irrelevant to this project, or to\nmusic making in general.\n\n\n"

Concert and \n&gt; &gt; CD reviews, educational discussions of essential recordings and \nmicrotonal \n&gt; &gt; repertoire, discussions of compositional technique (duh!!!), how \nform, \n&gt; &gt; rhythm, and affect might be effected by the technical choice of \nscale, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s Get Cracking: I&#39;m particularly seduced by 15-equal at the \nmoment.\n\nAwesome! My last making microtonal music session, on Tuesday, was \nentirely focused on 15-equal. It&#39;s easy on the Korg Karma: just set \nthe &quot;pitch slope&quot; on the oscillators to 0.8.\n\n&gt; Questions I \n&gt; really would love to ask:\n&gt; 1) What 15-equal pieces are there, which have you heard, which do \n&gt;you like and why? \n\nThere&#39;s a lot of stuff. Out of Blackwood&#39;s, I like the electronic \netude more than the guitar suite, but the open strings in the latter \nform the juicy 5-equal pentad. I&#39;ve enjoyed Herman Miller&#39;s &quot;Mizarian \nPorcupine Overture&quot; in several versions, and that&#39;s in 15-equal. \nRandy Winchester did something nice with it, as did other tuning list \npeople I can&#39;t recall at the moment. I haven&#39;t heard Clem Fortuna&#39;s \nmusic yet, but I hope to.\n\n&gt; Which would in fact be &quot;essential&quot;?\n\nI plan to create some :)\n\n&gt; 2) What are your successes/failures in getting average musicians to \nhear and play the \n&gt; intervals found within 15 (which I find myself categorizing as [1/1 \n16/15 12/11 8/\n&gt; 7 6/5 5/4 21/16 11/8] plus their octave-inversions)?\n\nI think different intervals can be heard in different ways, depending \non context. So I don&#39;t think such a &#39;rationalization&#39; is useful at \nall -- particularly intervals as complex as 21/16. For example, the 3-\nstep interval is close to 8/7, but can even be easily heard as a \nfunctional 7/6 in some contexts -- such as the music we were making \non Tuesday. I&#39;d be happy to go a lot further on this on the tuning \nlist, if you ask.\n\n&gt; How do they react to the \n&gt; absence of anything resembling a whole tone?\n\nYou don&#39;t want to try anything too diatonic-scaley in 15 -- this is \none of the major failings of Blackwood&#39;s guitar suite, in my opinion. \nEither keep the modulations flowing faster than the scale can \ncomplete itself, or use other scales -- I especially like \nthe &#39;porcupine&#39; scales (3 2 2 2 2 2 2 and 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 -- also try \nreplacing the &#39;3&#39; with 2+1 or 1+2) and the &#39;blackwood&#39; scale (2 1 2 1 \n2 1 2 1 2 1, variations possible). These are rich in triads and make \nfor nice smooth alien melodies . . . they also have unique chord \nprogressions and modulations that can&#39;t be done in 12-equal . . .\n\n&gt; 3)  What, from your experience, is 15 *good* at?  How does it \n&gt;affect form, rhythm, \n&gt; affect? (This is, of course, the only thing that people mean by \n&gt;the &quot;mood&quot; of a scale.)\n\n15 keeps you moving fast, since most of the intervals are pretty far \nfrom JI, and sitting on them can be &quot;painful&quot;. Notable exceptions are \nthe 4- and 11-step intervals (which are great approximations of 6:5 \nand 5:3).\n\n\n"

For example, I&#39;ve written two large-scale\n&gt; extended works in 15-tET, about 2 hours worth of music.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do I like 15-tET? I dunno... it has a really different melodic sound\n&gt; that&#39;s nowhere near a &quot;recognizable diatonic&quot; system. It has some nice\n&gt; smooth intervals and some pretty rough intervals, which seem to give a\n&gt; great variety of weird chords in addition to pretty fair &quot;triads&quot;. E.g.,\n&gt; the &quot;pythagorean 3rd&quot; of 400 cents with wide 5th of 720 make a really\n&gt; vibrant &quot;major&quot; chord; and there are a couple types of &quot;minor&quot; chord\n&gt; (320cents + 640 cents, or 320cents + 720cents)... Etcetera and so forth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, Jacob: Where&#39;d you get the 15-tet piano sound in &quot;3.3.mp3&quot; ???\n&gt;\n&gt; (BTW, I&#39;ve been long-time looking for a &quot;piano&quot; VSTi that is both\n&gt; convincing and can load &quot;.tun&quot; files (or even Scala files)... I&#39;ve use the\n&gt; 4Front piano module and mdaPiano; both are pretty OK... Does anyone know a\n&gt; VSTi that can do a good microtonal piano???)\n&gt;\n&gt;         Rick\n&gt;\n&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; More MMM music files are at http://www.microtonal.org/music.html\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]\n&gt; Yahoo!

Certainly if I devised a tuning system like\nGene&#39;s ennealimmal -- a really clever name -- I&#39;d want to use that\nname and celebrate it when discussing progressions or pieces using\nit. By the way, Gene has designed another tuning with a really neat\nname that I&#39;ll describe when I write a piece in it, a good incentive.\n\nMy general leaning _on MMM_ might be toward theory that more or less\nimmediately relates to an actual piece or example, sometimes in an\nalphabetical or numerical notation (the former used in certain\nmedieval European treatises), but preferably in some audio format,\nlike the files of my 14-tET examples which Aaron Johnson has so\nhelpfully and graciously prepared.\n\nIn contrast, I might wisely exercise special caution about generalized\ndiscussions that debate the merits of different tunings or categories\nof tuning systems; such comparisons can easily and quickly become\ninvidious, at least to one or more parties involved. The result can be\nthreads at once rather remote from composition or improvisation or\nperformance, and highly contentious -- a bit different from the kind\nof musicmaking focus envisioned in our guidelines.\n\nHere are some examples of things I might seek to do or avoid in MMM,\nkeeping in view its specific character.\n\n\n                      ------------------------\n                      Things I might do in MMM\n                      ------------------------\n\n1. Telling how I came to use a tuning system such as Peppermint 24 or\n20-tET, and briefly explaining what an unfamiliar or less familiar\nname means (e.g. Sesquisexta, simply the Latin term for &quot;7:6,&quot; since\nthis tuning has two 12-note Pythagorean chains of pure fifths at a 7:6\napart).\n\n2. Writing some running commentary about my adventures in a given\ntuning, or an amusing goof I made in counting scale steps, or a\ncurious historical comparison that occurred to me when playing or\nimprovising a given passage -- but including the passage in some form\nof notation or ideally audio rendition, and exercising some moderation\nas to length, in contrast to my habits in certain other forums &lt;grin&gt;.\n\n3. Explaining some basic rules of counterpoint or interval progression\nthat I take for granted, but that lots of readers might not. For\nexample, I might note that an &quot;intensive&quot; progression involves\nascending semitonal motion, and a &quot;remissive&quot; progression descending\nsemitonal motion.\n\n4. Communicating a bit about my interval preferences, possibly one\nsubtopic of &quot;microtonal aesthetics.&quot; In understanding the allure for\nme of a tuning like 14-tET, readers find it interesting to know that I\nconsider 429 cents &quot;a superb major third&quot; (or supermajor, to apply a\ncommon term), and 942 cents a very wonderful size for an interval\n(here I wasn&#39;t disappointed, as noted in one recent post).\n\n5. Discussing timbral practices and assumptions: for example, that in\ndiscussing 14-tET, I&#39;m basing my comments on synthesizer registrations\nchosen or designed to tone down the beating of 686-cent fifths and\n514-cent fourths.\n\n6. Offering and gratefully receiving information that might clarify\ncategories of tunings or performance practices discussed here, such as\nDaniel Wolf&#39;s very helpful comments that my &quot;pelog&quot; tunings in 14-tET\nof 0-1-6-8-9-14 and 0-1-3-8-9-14 might better fit the Sundanese\ncategories of sorog and degung. I want to get these things right, and\nsuch information also encourages me (and possibly others) to learn\nmore about musical and intonational traditions, enriching our own\npractices.\n\n7. Including some humor, especially about myself.\n\n8. Acknowledging and celebrating some of the ideas and examples I&#39;ve\ngotten from sister/brother list members and others.\n\n9. Sometimes introducing &quot;practical comparisons&quot; of how, for example,\nI might play the same basic type of progression in different tuning\nsystems.\n\n10. Giving information of a kind that might help someone else use a\ntuning (e.g. a Scala file), or understand the sizes of the intervals\nthat I&#39;m using and discussing (e.g. cents, integer ratios, or scale\nsteps in an equal temperament or well-temperament).\n\n\n                      ----------------------------\n                      Things I might not do in MMM\n                      ----------------------------\n\n1. Getting into a long technical discussion about the fine points of\nscale design and optimization of a given tuning system, especially the\nkind of exposition at some length that might make a fine essay for\nsome other forum.\n\n2. Taking a given interval or progression in a tuning system I&#39;m\nenjoying as the starting point for a comprehensive essay on a topic\nlike different interpretations of the division of the whole-tone into\n&quot;five parts&quot; proposed by Marchettus of Padua in 1318, or the scholarly\nliterature as to proposed values in cents for the two 36-note per\noctave tunings described by Nicola Vicentino for his archicembalo or\n&quot;superharpsichord&quot; in 1555.\n\n3. Presenting an elaborate discussion on 14th-century or 16th-century\nEuropean contrapuntal theory.\n\n4. Posting an involved theoretical discussion of at least 400 lines on\nmedieval European consonance/dissonance theory as it relates to my\ntaste in tunings -- again, something fun for other forums, but which I\nmight better do here in a paragraph or so, surrounded by musical\nexamples.\n\n5. Setting forth on a rather abstruse discussion on timbre/tuning\ninteractions and consonance/dissonance models -- something that might\nbe very relevant here if done more concisely, and linked to specific\nmusical examples (e.g. some of the &quot;xentonal&quot; music of Bill Sethares,\nor a performance in 22-tET by Paul Erlich where he applied his model\nof &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;).\n\n6. Getting into lengthly explications of fine points concerning\nmedieval or Renaissance genres or theoretical controversies -- yes,\nfor me this can be a curious form of entertainment -- which might\nserve more to distract from than to spice up the musicmaking that is\nour main focus. (An amusing historical anecdote, in 25 lines or less,\nmight be more like a touch of spice.)\n\n7. Posting remarks where I might feel a need to be assertive that my\nmusical viewpoint is a bit different from some &quot;norm,&quot; but which might\nbe made more _gently_ assertive, and so avoid the risk of needlessly\nputting another participant on the defensive, especially when there\nmight not actually be any disagreement. I mention this because I once\nmade a comment on another list that I really regret, fortunately\nreceived with a most noble friendliness and grace by the other person\nthat I would like to emulate more often.\n\n8. Getting involved in debates about the general merits of a given\ntuning system or musical style, even in &quot;self-defense.&quot; Of course, I\nmight respond more obliquely by presenting a musical example that\naddresses a given point, but preferably with a focus on the music,\nletting people draw their own conclusions.\n\n9. Theorizing about tunings with which I&#39;m unfamiliar -- with two\nqualifications. First, if a tuning someone else is using or inquiring\nabout is _almost_ identical to one I&#39;ve used (e.g. 31-tET vs. 1/4-comma\nmeantone), I might note this fact and go from there. Secondly, for\nexample, if someone asks, &quot;How can I make the 720-cent and 480-cent\nfifths and fourths in 15-tET more concordant?&quot; then I might address\nthis _specific_ question based on my experience with the same\nintervals in 20-tET.\n\n10. Posting a full analysis, for example, of all of the intervals\nfound or just ratios approximated in one of my 24-note tunings.\n\n\nThese are things often easier said than done -- or not done -- but\npossibly sharing a bit of how I&#39;d like to participate might give\nanother view in this dialogue.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n"

This is a piece I want to hear again and \nagain. It&#39;s *gorgeous* !!!!\n\nHarrison&#39;s (and the sensitive performer, David Tanenbaum&#39;s) ability to take \nhis/his time and use expressive space are exquisite. There is a distinct \nsarod- or sitar-like quality to the way Harrison is using the slide guitar \nhere, giving it a Western US as well as East Indian quality.\n\nSpeaking of the Western US, I was flooded with delightfully emotional images \nof lonely highways bathed in twilight sun, of the sort one may travel in \nMontana, Nevada, Wyoming, etc. Does anyone else have this sort of experience \non hearing this? It&#39;s the kind of unsentimental sentimentality that hits my \ncore and moves me very deeply.\n\nThe utter simplicity of the harmonic language, without artiface, is it&#39;s \ngreatest strength, and why it so incredibly moving for me. It&#39;s an object \nlesson, as most Indian music is, in how to keep a drone interesting. It&#39;s \nalso one of those rare pieces that remind one of music&#39;s power.\n\nThis is &#39;late-night-listen-with-candles-and-relax-and-unwind&#39; music, at its \nmost cosmically beautiful. What a fitting end to Harrison&#39;s life on this \n&#39;spaceship earth&#39; !!!\n\n10 out of 10 for raw expressive power.\n\nBest,\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

There is a \ndistinct \n&gt; sarod- or sitar-like quality to the way Harrison is using the slide \nguitar \n&gt; here, giving it a Western US as well as East Indian quality.\n\nAs you know, I work in this sort of combined genre as well (for any \nnewbies, check out \nhttp://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/paulerlichacousticmusic.htm -- \nunfortunately soundclick truncates after 10 minutes, so you can&#39;t \ntell that my improvisations have form :))\n\nThanks for sharing, this was a real pleasure, even if the JI version \nis only available on the commercial recording . . .\n\n\n"

Johnson&#39;s latest microtonal work (www.dividebypi.com).\n\nIf you are hoping for a repeat of the eclectic 19-tet \nharmonic motion of the &quot;Juggler&quot; or of the recent funky \nalgorithmic-oriented &quot;5-tet funk&quot; then you will be disappointed. \nRather, &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; shows a new side to Aaron&#39;s music: real \ntime microtonal improvisation. The music is aggressive, rhythmically \nsophisticated, and is varied both texturally and timbrally.\n\n&quot;Divide by Pi&quot; is a collaboration with percussionist Andy Hasenpflug,\nand most of the pieces are recordings of improvisations that feature\nsynth, percussion, and voice. The enticing vocal sounds are used \nas both a rhythmic and textural element; this is not lyrical\nradio-ready pop singing. \n\nBoth the opening &quot;prelude/jungle&quot; and &quot;bachelors grove&quot; (I thought \nthese guys were married?) move relentlessly forward, driven by\nthe vocal articulations used in a music-concrete kind of way.\nThe &quot;hommage a messiaen&quot; is starker, and has a compelling \nhand drum section that resolves to a faux operatic movement\nand then back. Very nice.\n\nThe quirky &quot;plastic bathtub toys&quot; reminds me of the\nPerry-Kinsley classic &quot;Camp Grenada.&quot; By the end, we are\nconvinced that both Aaron and Andy do indeed love their\nrubber ducks!\n\n&quot;Solid aviary&quot; begins with samples of birds, or perhaps they\nare synthesizer chirps. Either way, the sounds evolve using highly\ninflected pitch glides into a long sustained harsh timbre\nthat highlights the drumming. Each time the birds return they\nare a bit more synthetic, a bit more alien.\n\n&quot;Broad Liquid&quot; features a rhythmic drone. Voices\n&quot;oh&quot; and &quot;ah&quot; with an intensity reminiscent of &quot;Dead Can Dance.&quot;\nAgain, Andy&#39;s drumming is the motor force underneath the\nmicrotonal synth lines. By the middle of the improv section\nI was thinking of Pink Floyd&#39;s small furry creatures in a cave.\n\nI hope and Aaron and Andy didn&#39;t really spill\nany blood in the making of &quot;blood sacrifice at stonehenge.&quot; \nThough I doubt this is what druids really sounded\nlike (and I also doubt that druids played in 7-tet),\nit is a haunting piece with Andy&#39;s driving rhythms \npropelling the chanting.\n\nI might liked to have a bit more detail about the tunings used\nin the pieces, and there is no mention in the liner notes \nof what kinds of synths or drums are used. On the other hand,\nwe have Aaron right here on MMM, so I suppose we can ask!\nIn case you can&#39;t tell, I think &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; is great\nmusic. Congratulations Aaron and Andy!\n\n--Bill Sethares\n\n\n"

He really is a \nwonderful, high energy player, with a solid rhythmic pocket, and a \nwonderfully quirky vocalist too (we both share vocal duties)\n\n&#39;prelude/jungle&#39;, &#39;bachelor&#39;s grove&#39; (yes we are married--it&#39;s the name of a \nfamous haunted Chicago graveyard where Capone used to dump gangland murder \nvictims), and &#39;plastic bathtub toys&#39; use Grady&#39;s &#39;Centaur tuning&#39;, although \nmany of the synth patches are so FM-based, with their non-harmonic spectra, \nit&#39;s hard to notice. &#39;hommage a messiaen&#39; is a showcase for Paul Hahn&#39;s \n7-limit 32-consonance tuning. &#39;broad liquid&#39; is a drone, where I play with \nthe filters to get the otonal series with the resonance, so the tuning is \nirrelevant. &#39;blood sacrifice at stonehenge&#39; is 7-tet. &#39;solid aviary&#39; is all \nover the map tuning wise--it was so free and Morton Subotnick &#39;Silver Apples&#39; \nlike that tuning info is besides the point....it was pure synth fun!!!!\n\nThanks again Bill and Jon for your support and flattering comments; in the \ntruest sense, we do it for the few like you who are in that subsection of the \nworld population who share our quirky take on music.....\n\nBy the way, Bill, I&#39;m starting a seperate thread re: your disks...\n\nCiao!!\n\nOn Saturday 01 May 2004 06:49 pm, Bill Sethares wrote:\n&gt; I received my copy of &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; recently --\n&gt; Aaron K. Johnson&#39;s latest microtonal work (www.dividebypi.com).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are hoping for a repeat of the eclectic 19-tet\n&gt; harmonic motion of the &quot;Juggler&quot; or of the recent funky\n&gt; algorithmic-oriented &quot;5-tet funk&quot; then you will be disappointed.\n&gt; Rather, &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; shows a new side to Aaron&#39;s music: real\n&gt; time microtonal improvisation. The music is aggressive, rhythmically\n&gt; sophisticated, and is varied both texturally and timbrally.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; is a collaboration with percussionist Andy Hasenpflug,\n&gt; and most of the pieces are recordings of improvisations that feature\n&gt; synth, percussion, and voice. The enticing vocal sounds are used\n&gt; as both a rhythmic and textural element; this is not lyrical\n&gt; radio-ready pop singing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both the opening &quot;prelude/jungle&quot; and &quot;bachelors grove&quot; (I thought\n&gt; these guys were married?) move relentlessly forward, driven by\n&gt; the vocal articulations used in a music-concrete kind of way.\n&gt; The &quot;hommage a messiaen&quot; is starker, and has a compelling\n&gt; hand drum section that resolves to a faux operatic movement\n&gt; and then back. Very nice.\n&gt;\n&gt; The quirky &quot;plastic bathtub toys&quot; reminds me of the\n&gt; Perry-Kinsley classic &quot;Camp Grenada.&quot; By the end, we are\n&gt; convinced that both Aaron and Andy do indeed love their\n&gt; rubber ducks!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Solid aviary&quot; begins with samples of birds, or perhaps they\n&gt; are synthesizer chirps. Either way, the sounds evolve using highly\n&gt; inflected pitch glides into a long sustained harsh timbre\n&gt; that highlights the drumming. Each time the birds return they\n&gt; are a bit more synthetic, a bit more alien.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Broad Liquid&quot; features a rhythmic drone. Voices\n&gt; &quot;oh&quot; and &quot;ah&quot; with an intensity reminiscent of &quot;Dead Can Dance.&quot;\n&gt; Again, Andy&#39;s drumming is the motor force underneath the\n&gt; microtonal synth lines. By the middle of the improv section\n&gt; I was thinking of Pink Floyd&#39;s small furry creatures in a cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope and Aaron and Andy didn&#39;t really spill\n&gt; any blood in the making of &quot;blood sacrifice at stonehenge.&quot;\n&gt; Though I doubt this is what druids really sounded\n&gt; like (and I also doubt that druids played in 7-tet),\n&gt; it is a haunting piece with Andy&#39;s driving rhythms\n&gt; propelling the chanting.\n&gt;\n&gt; I might liked to have a bit more detail about the tunings used\n&gt; in the pieces, and there is no mention in the liner notes\n&gt; of what kinds of synths or drums are used. On the other hand,\n&gt; we have Aaron right here on MMM, so I suppose we can ask!\n&gt; In case you can&#39;t tell, I think &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; is great\n&gt; music. Congratulations Aaron and Andy!\n&gt;\n&gt; --Bill Sethares\n\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

I remember the delight upon finding a \nsample of &#39;The Turquoise Dabo Girl&#39;, enjoying the strange futuristic sound of \na world that for me conjured Kubrick&#39;s plastic nightmare world of the &#39;Milk \nBar&#39; in &#39;A Clockwork Orange&#39;.\n\nSpeaking of &#39;Clockwork Orange&#39;, where Bill Sethares is not yet the razor-sharp \nproducer/composer the likes of a Wendy Carlos, (how many mortals are?, and \nbear in mind I still have to hear most of the 2nd disc, &#39;Exomusicology&#39;) the \nbest tunes are quite strong indeed, and he makes up for what I feel are the \nweaker parts with a very studied encyclopedic survey of various tunings, and \nmore specifically and most importantly, how tuning and timbre should fit \ntogether, a field of expertise in which he is known in these parts as an \nundisputed master researcher. In this sense, this is one of the more \nimportant microtonal disks out there, and to top it off, the music at its \nbest is delightful.\n\nThe &#39;Xentonality&#39; disk is 16 tracks full (yes, a cornucopia !) of what I would \ncall &#39;etudes&#39;, not in the 19th-century virtuoso-performer sense, but in the \n&#39;study&#39; sense, of tuning.  In general, all the tracks are well worth the \nhearing, but since there are *16* of them, and I write this review at 1 in \nthe am, let me briefly describe the ones I felt were standouts for me, (which \nwere mostly the ones furthest from being modelled on pop style writing--I \nreveal my style bias). It *is* impressive what a variety of masks Bill wears \nstylistically, not to mention the technical importance of his work in tuning \nand timbre.\n\nWe are thrown into the Marrekesh marketplace, I feel, with the opener &#39;Ten \nFingers&#39;, where 10-tet never sounded so harmonious! There is also great use \nof stereo field in this track. However, sometimes the performance is a bit \nmarred by unsimultaneous attacks and loose time, creating a certain \nintoxicated looseness of tempo feel. Or was this deliberate? (humanizing \nfunction in a sequencer? -- without details of the production process it&#39;s \nhard to tell) This looseness was sometimes noticeable on other tracks as \nwell.\n\n&#39;Circle of Thirds&#39; (track 2) is like a 10-tet rotating kaleidescope with a \nspacious, almost ominous middle section. It ends abrubtly and delightfully, \nand features a kind of portamento synth lead that I&#39;ve since noticed is a \nsort of Sethares trademark. &#39;PentaFunk&#39; (not from this album) and &#39;Turquois \nDabo Girl&#39; (from this album) use it.\n\nMy favorite track on the album, &#39;Duet for Morphine and Cymbal&#39; is so vastly \nunique in the microtonal recording oeuvre, as well as for this collection, \nwith it&#39;s eerie organic pulsing and hallucinogenic quality, that it might be \nthe most important musical statement of all of Bill&#39;s output that I&#39;ve heard. \nThis to me was pure magic, a deftly and simply conceived work which reminded \nme of the best electronic music put on record to date, from the likes of \nMorton Subotnick or Tod Dockstader. It definately has a great &#39;retro-sci-fi&#39; \nfeel, and is very tightly performed as well. The fascinating liner notes \nindicate that the timbres are derived from the x-ray diffraction patterns of \na morphine crystal !! Bill, please do an LSD piece for us !!! (or even THC?)\n\nDitto the next track &#39;Tingshaw&#39; which was so delightfully and gently metallic, \nI listened to it three times in a row. The scale is derived from the tuning \nof the bell sample. This track is up there, perhaps next to, the high musical \nlevel of &#39;Duet...&#39; Again, wonderful stereo field and use of percussive drum \nelements as well. Here, the timing was not at all marred in the way some of \nthe other, more pop-oriented tracks were. Bill seems &#39;In his element&#39; or &#39;In \nflow&#39; on this and the previous track. There&#39;s also a neat little place where \nthe music unpredictably stops and restarts it&#39;s momentum. Very delicious...\n\nA problematic track for me was &#39;Incidence and Coincidence&#39;--it&#39;s starts out as \nan innocuous sounding, almost dopey little tune, and then rips into a nice \nprog-rock type theme, worthy of King Crimson or Yes, 44 seconds into it. My \nproblem is I *love* the &#39;heavy&#39; second theme where it occurs, but don&#39;t care \nall that much for the surrounding material. Perhaps a track of the &#39;heavy \ntheme&#39; alone, entitled &#39;Coincidence&#39;, remixed for yours truly? ;) The piece \n*does* have a fascinating genesis--the study of how 19-tet and 12-tet can \ncoexist.\n\nTwo pieces for Gary Morrison&#39;s 88-cent tuning come next, &#39;Haroun in 88&#39; and \n&#39;88 vibes&#39;, of which the latter stands out for its fragile, explosive, and \npleasantly glassy vibraphone arpeggios, which flank a stately middle section \nreminiscent of a royal processional with a pop music slant.\n\n&#39;Truth on a Bus&#39; is simply a 19-tet guitar piece--the liner notes allude to Ry \nCooder style, I heard a bit of Leo Kottke&#39;s delicious style in there as well. \nWonderfully simple and moving, and one of the strongest tracks on the record.\n\n&#39;Imaginary horses&#39;, in a Lou Harrison 5-limit minor hexatonic scale, has a \nwonderful disarming simplicity to it, and a good use of &#39;galloping piano&#39; \ntexture.\n\nFinally, also one of the top 5 or so tracks for me, the &#39;Turquoise Dabo Girl&#39; \n(11-tet) relishes, as I alluded above, the world of the futuristic night-club \nperhaps. We seem to swim in a nightmarish room of purple and lavendar with \nrobotic women waitresses and lava lamps, art deco furniture and silver space \nboots. Very vivid, darkly humorous, too!!!!\n\nIn short, a wonderful disc containing some delicious pieces of music \nillustrating a seminal concept from a leading composer/theorist that deserves \nevery bit of its reputation as a landmark in the field. Bravo, Bill !!!!\n\n(more to come on &#39;exomusicology&#39;)\n\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Even 4-equal is capable of \n&gt; &gt;musical qualities, strange to relate; though it has all the features I \n&gt; &gt;complain of in 5-equal, only worse. But 4 or 5 equal means you can \n&gt; &gt;concentrate on the broad outlines.\n&gt; \n&gt; To which Jon replied...\n&gt; I swear, I&#39;ve never even remotely seen anything like this mentioned! I \n&gt; realize you do a lot of harmonization, but many people find the \n&gt; composition/performance of multiple-pitch tunings to be difficult with a \n&gt; traditional kbd layout, and I had no idea this is the tack you were following.\n\nI&#39;m with Jon here. This is a very interesting and unique way of\nworking. It had never occurred to me to use one tuning (4-tet or 5-tet in your\nexample) as a vehicle for composing in another (say 15-tet). \n\nIn a way, this is kind of the reverse of the Schenker method of\nanalysis, but applied to non-I-V-I music. The 5-tet forms the harmonic skeleton\nwhich can then be fleshed out using the full harmonic resources of the larger\ntuning.\n\nIt is making me think that I should take one of my new 5-tet pieces\nand see if there is a way to rehamonize it in 10-tet, 15-tet,ormaybe 20-tet... \n\nThanks!\n\n--Bill Sethares\n\n\n"

The 5-tet forms the\nharmonic skeleton\n&gt; which can then be fleshed out using the full harmonic resources of\nthe larger\n&gt; tuning.\n\nI think of the 5-et as forming a non-harmonic skeleton, with no\nharmonic data carried by it; harmonic data comes from a second,\nseparately created source the way I work it.\n\n&gt; It is making me think that I should take one of my new 5-tet pieces\n&gt; and see if there is a way to rehamonize it in 10-tet, 15-tet,ormaybe\n20-tet... \n\nThat would be quite different, but I think it would be worth persuing.\nOne possibility would be to start with 3; for each note you next\ndecide if it should get a +1, a 0, or a -1; this gives you 9-et. Doing\nit again gives you 27-et, and again 81-et--all of which have their\nuses, though if you planned to make use of meantone in 81 after all of\nthis I&#39;d say good luck.

Here&#39;s what you would have to do:\n\nMake a tuning table T of 128 note frequencies in 14-tet. For each note in  \nthe MIDI file you are converting, calculate the frequency of the note by  \nadding the pitchbend offset to/from the associated MIDI note number. And  \nfor that MIDI note number, substitute the MIDI note number in the 14-tet  \ntuning table T with the frequency closed to the one you found.\n\nThis will involve *changing* MIDI note numbers, not just &quot;stripping pitch bends&quot;.\n\n\tRick\n\n"

It&#39;s *great* !!!&#39;, a valid and concise description of \nthe experience of hearing this CD.\n\nThere are even more tracks (19) than there were on the &#39;Xentonality&#39; Cd, and \nthis 2nd CD (from 2002) shows what five more years of musical and technical \nexperience has given Bill&#39;s work. I find the &#39;exomusicology&#39; disk a much more \nevenly high level listening experience, and sonically richer. As well, there \nis a tighter rhythmic feel.\n\n&#39;Apprehension of Time&#39; and &#39;Persistence of Time&#39; reveal Bill in what I call \nhis &#39;percussive mode&#39;, where &#39;spectral drumming&#39; is dominant (although in \n&#39;Persistence of Time&#39; there are quite a few othere synth lines going on as \nwell). These are quite enjoyably &#39;cro-magnon&#39; tracks, and as a composer, I \nfinish hearing them refreshed and inspired to explore some of the directions \nBill opens up.\n\nA very funky humourous track is &#39;Local Anomaly&#39;, where a guitar-like timbre \nBill calls a &#39;triangulaika&#39; (a play on Balalaika) is composed to do adaptive \nreal-time JI adjustments to the next simultaneous pitches.\n\nThere are several extremely unique and special tracks to be found on this \ndisk. Notable is &#39;Over Venus&#39; for its beautifully alien take on overtones and \ndrones. An instrument the liner notes calls a &#39;Klein trumpet&#39; has a strange \ndisembodied sound to it that is quite striking. &#39;When everything was \nsimultaneous&#39; and &#39;Temporal Consciousness&#39; use speech elements in a uniquely \nstrange and spectral way. This listener has heard nothing quite like it.\n\n&#39;Intersecting Spheres&#39; is notable for its use of a gorgeous stereo field where \nall sorts of very optimistic sounding &#39;Close encounters&#39; type sounds groove \nover an afro-cuban type rhythm. It&#39;s sure to put a smile on your face.\n\n&#39;Pulsing Silences&#39; and &#39;Nexus&#39; are different yet similar tour-de-force studies \nof how much can be done with a single note (overtone series music) is there \nis sufficient spectral variation. Wonderful &#39;ambient electronica&#39; tracks. \nBill could, and should, come out with a whole album of this style alone, and \nit would get gobbled up greedily by the Brian Eno crowd.\n\nWe enter the realm of the tongue-and-cheek &#39;Star Trek&#39; geek crown with \n&#39;Sonork&#39; and &#39;Rojqoq&#39;, which both have a nice heavy aggresiveness to them.\nThere are great llittle subtle layers of &#39;Star Trek&#39; ship sounds placed into \nthe mix of the latter ! These tracks are a lot of fun, and show Bill at his \nhumourous best.\n\nThere are 2 &#39;cosmic 7-tet gamelan&#39; tracks. &#39;Pagan&#39;s revenge&#39;, a stellar, \nenergetic track which is structurally a giant melodic palindrome, has a \nwonderfully knotty line that grabs your attention and doesn&#39;t let it go.\nAnd &#39;Nothing Broken in Seven&#39; builds its gorgeously kaleidescopic texture with \ntechniques of delay that are reminiscent of Steve Reich. I don&#39;t know if my \ndisk was flawed, but this track, the last track of the disk, ends abrubptly \nat 3:25 as if the cosmic arts council ran out of yttrium recording media!!!\n\nA very enjoyable disk, folks, definately a must-own if one wants to have some \ncurrent and essential microtonal repertoire!!!\n\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

This listener has heard nothing quite like it.\n\nOK. I admit -- it&#39;s not really a trumpet made from a Klein bottle.\n\nIt started as a pretty generic flute sample (I can&#39;t remember whether \nit was an &quot;alto flute&quot; or whether I just didn&#39;t use the upper octaves).\nAnyway, I played the piece (about 30-40 seconds of a sustained droney effect)\nin an overtone tuning using a WX-5 wind controller.\nIt sat around for quite a while because it didn&#39;t really sound all that good.\n\nThen I was developing some FFT based routines which do the following:\n(1) break the piece up into (roughly) 1/2 second segments (sometimes overlapped).\n(2) take the spectrum (FFT)\n(3) locate the largest n peaks (n might be 2 or 5 or 20, depending on the source).\n(4) move those peaks to the nearest harmonic series\n(5) invert the changed spectrum back into a time signal\n\nSo - what you hear in &quot;Over Venus&quot; is the same 30-40 seconds repeated\nseveral times (cut and paste) but each time using a different set of parameters\nin the routines (e.g., different segment sizes, different n, different overlaps).\n\nYou hear all the high tinkly stuff? All of that is unintended byproducts or artifacts of\nthe algorithm. Very often when you do analysis/resynthesis methods, you get weird\ntinkley and jangley things going on... this is especially true when the length of the\nanalysis segments is large (like the 1/2 second used here). I&#39;ve actually spent a\nridiculous amount of time attempting to remove the artifacts from the process,\nbut in this case, I decided that the artifacts themselves were quite cool.\n\nIn fact, this is the same kind of algorithmic manipulation used in both\n&quot;Temporal Consciousness&quot; and &quot;When everything was Simultaneous&quot; though of course\nit was applied to vocal based samples (and a didgeridoo sample) rather than \nthe flute. The artifacts are quite striking -- in both of these what happens\nis that when you do the FFT segmenting and change the phase, it\nscrambles up the signal. Using different size segments changes the scrambling from\nrapid to an almost stuttering effect.\n\nAs I was writing this message, I remembered another piece using (more or less)\nthe same technique. It&#39;s called &quot;VarMixUp&quot; because it&#39;s all variable and mixed up (this is a\n&quot;working title&quot;). For a variety of reasons, &quot;VarMixUp&quot; didn&#39;t make it onto \nExomusicology. Anyway, you can download it at:\n\nhttp://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/VarMixUp.mp3\n\nEnjoy!\n\n--Bill Sethares\n\n\n"

I believe \nthat Lou \n&gt; was acutely aware of this and used very strict formal methods as, \n&gt; effectively, a substitute for the deep cultural background that he \ncould \n&gt; not bring to new materials. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you are committed to your project as an improvisational one, I \ncan \n&gt; not immage any reason why improvisation should not be compatible \nwith \n&gt; such formal controls, indeed, I suspect it might give you more \n&gt; opportunity to attend to the surface (ornaments, articulation) of \nyour \n&gt; improvisation.\n\nThanks so much Daniel. Is there any information on the Web about \nthese formal controls? At the moment we&#39;re mainly working on playing \nin odd meters such as 5 and 7, but it would certainly be a great time \nfor us to inject *form* as a conscious object of training.\n\n[PS: I&#39;m keenly aware that the examples up there are &quot;noodling&quot; in \nthe main (you even hear me fixing the tuning several times), and the \nlittle formal structure that they do have is chopped off by the 10-\nminute time limit, so you can&#39;t hear it. The percussionist and I \nhappened to be invited, without warning, into a recording studio, and \nthe inspiration that leads to memorable (or maybe just remembering) \nmelodic figures, or spontaneously tight formal structures, was \nclearly lacking that day. As you hear me say on the \nrecording, &quot;Where&#39;s your heart&quot; -- in a search for the suprapersonal \nmusical spirit that sometimes does inhabit our explorations . . . \ninstead, the recording captured some robotic machinations. This is my \nimpression, but so many people responded so positively to the \nrecording that I felt obliged to put it up on the web . . .]\n\n\n"

Just for information, not at \n&gt;all as advertisements!  :-)\n\nYes, I think so, but maybe if all of us keep some of the following in mind:\n\n&gt;Something like &quot;the next version of xyz will support microtuning by \n&gt;loading a certain tuning file format.&quot;\n\nI am finding this not so helpful - in the last couple of years we see some \npeople that say they will offer microtuning, but it is either not done or \ndone in such an awkward manner as to be unusable in a realistic way. However...\n\n&gt;Or, &quot;the last avalaible version of xyz is now handling microtuning via a \n&gt;specific internal setting: blah blah blah&quot;.\n\nThis is much better, which I will elaborate on below.\n\n&gt;Or also, &quot;could you help me in my microtuning crusade to convince such \n&gt;software editor to include an alternate tuning feature&quot; etc, etc.\n\nI have seen these kind of items get posted, but one must remember: this is \na *very* small community. At best, we could hope that a couple of \nindividuals could write up well thought-out reasons for a developer to \nsupport it, especially if they can supply them with an overview of current \ntuning file formats, etc. There is _no_way_ we could ever convince them \nthat they will recoup a lot of effort through sales; this group currently \nnumbers around 200, and there are forums dedicated to single softsynths \nthat have over ten times that many members! We are a quite small group.\n\nBut by slowly amassing a body of good music, that shows what can be done, \nwe might be able to convince both the developers AND the musicians that it \nis an avenue worthy of pursuit; this is happening more recently. But unless \nI personally am convinced that a significant number of people might \nactually purchase a particular micro app, I&#39;m not going to try and lead a \ngroup effort to convince the developer to put in a lot of work - they need \nto do it because it seems like the right or interesting thing to do. As it \nstands now, that feature will hardly pay for itself.\n\nBUT! If you come across instruments or environments that allow microtuning, \ndo it well, and *especially* if you&#39;ve used it and can show some examples, \nthen it very much IS a good and positive thing to post about. Be sure you \ncheck the list of hardware and software synths at John Loffink&#39;s pages, as \nmost anything listed there has already been discussed here:\n\nhttp://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/\n\nAnyone else is welcome to chime in on this topic.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

I don&#39;t want this to sound like crass \ncommercialism, but these small companies (and large ones, too) take the \ntime and effort to add the features, and I&#39;m sure it makes it a positive \nexperience when they know that it causes not only more sales, but happy users.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

At least, for those I like and use as &#39;tonal&#39;\nsynths.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;&quot;the next version of xyz will support microtuning by \n&gt; &gt;loading a certain tuning file format.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I am finding this not so helpful - in the last couple of years we\n&gt; see some people that say they will offer microtuning, but it is\n&gt; either not done or done in such an awkward manner as to be unusable\n&gt; in a realistic way. However...\n\nI agree! ;-)\n\n \n&gt; &gt;convince software editor to include an alternate tuning feature\n\n&gt; write up well thought-out reasons for a developer to \n&gt; support it, especially if they can supply them with an overview of \n&gt; current tuning file formats, etc. There is _no_way_ we could ever\n&gt; convince them...\n\nWell, what I observe as journalist is when I ask for an &#39;alternate\ntuning&#39; feature request for such or such software, I always get a\nreply. I couldn&#39;t say (write) the same about hardware.\nAnd what needs a developer? A SDK (aka Sample Developer Kit), a piece\nof code easy to implement in their software. If we can provide a such\npiece of code, that works; otherwise...\nThe great and only source code actually usable has been released by\nMark Henning. And it&#39;s from this code that some developers have\nalready included a microtuning feature (LinPlug), and some others are\ncurrently working on.\n\n&gt; Anyone else is welcome to chime in on this topic.\n\nThank you very much Jonathan!\nKindest regards,\nPhilippe\n\n\n"

While there are some aesthetic\nand compositional points I might discuss, maybe it would be better to\nlet people listen first and give their own reactions.\n\nSuffice it for now to say that whatever merit this little piece might\nhave owes a lot to such classics as the Missa Tournai, for example,\nand also to the tradition of a piece such as a motet composed for an\noccasion of state.\n\nMy apologies, of course, for any errata or glitches in the MIDI or the\nscore.\n\nA note on the tuning system: this is Peppermint 24, something with\nwhich I&#39;m familiar, although I _do_ intend to write a piece in 25-tET\nalso as you proposed. My keyboard notation, as usual, has an asterisk\nsign (*) to show a note on the upper keyboard raised by ~58.68 cents.\nHere the piece is centered on the upper keyboard in order to obtain\nthe desired intervals.\n\nIn vocal performance, obviously, singers would approximate rather than\nprecisely follow this intonational model, and indeed might sing some\npure or closer-to-pure fifths where Peppermint has them tempered about\n2.14 cents wide.\n\nComposing this piece has been quite an experience, and thank you,\nMark, for helping to make it possible and providing that creative and\ncatalytic impetus to &quot;make micro music.&quot;\n\n                       *           *           *\n\n! _O Europae domus communis_, song to celebreate expansion of European\n! Union, composed 1-4 May 2004.\n\n! Composition for three voices in Peppermint 24, a tuning system where the\n! ratio between the sizes in cents of the chromatic and diatonic semitones\n! is equal to Phi (~1.618), with fifths at about 704.096 cents. Two\n! 12-note chains in this regular temperament are placed at a distance\n! of around 58.680 cents, producing some pure 7:6 minor thirds.\n\n! Basic rhythm is 6/8, with dotted quarter or crotchet as beat or tactus\n! Suggested tempo around 80-85 beats per minute (MIDI has 83-1/3)\n\n! Numbers above notes count main beats (two per measure), with\n! subdivision into eighths/quavers shown in relevant measures;\n! a comma in this line indicates a pause in the phrasing. Please note\n! that notes are generally sustained until the next note indicated\n! in that part or the end of the piece.\n\n          | 1  2  3   4  5  6   |\n1     2   | 1         2         | 1    2   | 1    2    |\nF*4   F*4  E*4    F*4 D*4   E*4   F*4  G*4   A*4  Bb*4\nC*4   C*4  B*3                    C*4  D*4   E*4  F*4\nF*3   F*3  G*3                    F*3  Bb*3  C*4  D*4\nO     Eu-  ro-                    pae  do-   mus  com-\n\n1  2  3   4   5  6   |        | 1  2  3  4  5  6  | 1  2  3   4 5 6 |\n1         2          | 1   2, | 1        2        | 1         2     | 1 2 |\nA*4   G*4 G*4    F*4   A*4      A*4      G*4   F*4  E*4   D*4 E*4     F*4\nE*4       D*4          E*4      E*4      D*4   C*4  B*3               C*4\nC*4       Bb*3         A*3      C*4      Bb*3  A*3  G*3               F*3\nmu        -            nis      am-      pli-  fi-  ca-               ta,\n\n        | 1  2  3   4  5  6  |                   | 1  2  3  4  5 6  |\n1    2  | 1         2        | 1    2  | 1    2  | 1        2       | 1 2,|\nF*4       G*4   F*4 E*4   D*4  F*4  F*4  G*4  A*4  A*4  G*4 G*4  F*4  A*4\nC*4       D*4   C*4 B*3        C*4  C*4  D*4  E*4  D*4      D*4       E*4\nF*3  A*4  G*3       G*3        F*3  A*3  Bb*3 C*4  Bb*3     Bb*3      A*3\nO    _    Gal  -    li    -    a    vox  no-  bi-  lis-     si-       ma\n\n                           | 1  2  3   4  5  6  |\n1    2   | 1   2  | 1   2  | 1         2        | 1   2  | 1   2 |\nA*4  G*4   G4       G*4      G*4       F*4   E*4  D*4 E*4  F*4\nE*4  D*4   D4       D*4      D*4   E*4 D*4        C*4 B*3  C*4\nC*4  Bb*3  A*3      G*3      G*3                           F*3\nque  -     ru-      lae      pa-                           cis:\n\n                                     (duplets)\n1    2   | 1   2  | 1    2   | 1     2   +   | 1    2  | 1  2  |\nE*4  E*4   E4       E*4        F*4   F*4 F*4   E*4  F*4  F4\nA*3  A*3   B*3      A*3        D4    D4  D4    D4   D4   D*4\nA*3  A*3   A3       A*3        A*3   A*3 A*3   A*3  A*3  Bb3\nEx   du-   me-      to         il-   la- que-  an-  te   bel-\n\n                             | 1  2  3    4  5  6 |\n1    2   | 1   2  | 1    2   | 1          2       | 1  2, | 1    2   |\n           F4       F*4        F*4   F*4  G*4       A*4     A*4  G*4\nC*4  C4    C*4      Bb*3       D*4   D*4  D*4       E*4     E*4  D*4\n           Bb3      Bb*3       Bb*3  Bb*3 Bb*3      A*3     A*3  A*3\n                    lis        du-   ci-  te        nos     Ut   prae-\n\n1  2  3  4   5  6 |                                | 1  2  3  4  5  6 |\n1        2        | 1   2, | 1   2 | 1  2 | 1   2  | 1        2       |\nG4       E*4 G4     G*4      A*4     G*4    G*4      G*4      F*4  E*4\nD4       B*3 D4     D*4      D*4     D*4    E*4      E*4      D*4\nA*3      A*3        G*3      G*3            G*3      G*3\nva-      le  -      at       con     -      cor      -\n\n1    2   | 1    2 ||\nD*4  E*4   F*4\nC*4  B*3   C*4\n     G*3   F*3\n -   di -  a.\n\n&quot;O common house of Europe enlarged,\n O France, most noble voice of imploring peace:\n Out of the entangling thicket of war, lead us\n So that concord may prevail.&quot;\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

If Jon&#39;s helpful comments don&#39;t address or solve your specific\nproblem, or for others with sound cards, etc., where this known glitch\nmight cause a problem, I&#39;ve produced another MIDI file where unisons\nbetween two voices are sounded in only one voice:\n\n            &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/o_euro1b.mid&gt;\n\nWith some devices, it seems, having two &quot;Note On&quot; messages for the same\nnote can get treated as a &quot;Note On&quot; almost immediately followed by a &quot;Note\nOff,&quot; abruptly cutting off the note. Thus I&#39;ve removed one of the notes at\nsuch places -- fortunately, in this piece, only a few -- to avoid such\nproblems.\n\nKraig, if this were a source of the difficulties you were having, I would\nexpect it to occur in the middle of the piece, since that is where these\nunisons occur; if it was happening at the beginning, for example, we might\nlook to another cause, for example as in Jon&#39;s suggestions.\n\nJon, thank you for your warm and encouraging comments, as always, and also\nfor your technical insights so aptly applied to the practical goal of\n&quot;making micro music.&quot;\n\nWhile this ties in with another thread where I might offer some further\ncomments, for now I will mention that Guenter Nagler&#39;s midi2txt utility\nfor converting a MIDI file to readable text of the commands which can be\nproofread has been very helpful for proofreading the MIDI output I get\nfrom the Scala EXAMPLE feature -- not to mention Manuel Op de Coul&#39;s\nScala! As has been commented elsewhere, it&#39;s appropriate early and often\nto let it be known that these programs are useful and appreciated.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n"

In Sibelius you input pitch \nbends as two numbers, the the first of which is 0, as the fine pitch bend does \nnot work with my Sound Canvas (or sib ignores any numbers you put in there)\n\nthe notation is ~B0,nn\n\nwhere nn is in the range -128 to 127. So if you set the maxx range of the pitch \nbend to 1 semitone up and down, you get 2 semitones divided into 255 parts, \nwhich is not a brilliant accuracy. but unless anyone has better experience with \nSib v.3 and microtones and Roland Soundcanvases, to achieve better \nintonation results, it&#39;s all I can do. Deviations from *exact* 19equal are \nproducts of the technology not impure compositional thinking.\n\nI anyone can produce a rendition using the exact implied tuning, I&#39;d be \ninterested to hear also. To suggest that I was using a different tuning by \nanalysing an electronic performance is incorrect - and in any case I suspect \nany real acoustic performance on two real recorders will have deviations far \nworse than my electronic ones, so the discussion vis a vis accuracy is largely \nmoot.\n\nStill, I&#39;m glad people like what I&#39;ve written.\n\nMark \n\n\n"

Judged as a\nmeantone it&#39;s in the region between 31 and 43, or 1/4 to 1/5 comma.\nMeantone[17] is simply what you get from 16 sucessive meantone fifths.\nIf you take these meantone fifths to be those of 43 equal, you can get\nsomething quite close to the pitch bends of Mark&#39;s scale from a\nparticular choice of 11 out of the 17 notes.\n\nAt this point if someone wants to verify my conclusions independently\nit would be nice; I&#39;d also like to hear from Mark concerning how,\nprecisely, he tuned his scale, and if he knows why it seems more like\n43 than 19. In any case, the scale and tuning he used seems to work to\nproduce actual music, which is the bottom line.\n\n\n"

In Sibelius you input pitch \n&gt; bends as two numbers, the the first of which is 0, as the fine pitch bend does \n&gt; not work with my Sound Canvas (or sib ignores any numbers you put in there)\n&gt; \n&gt; the notation is ~B0,nn\n&gt; \n\nI can only speak from experience from sibelius 2.  The pitch bend notation is the \nsame there, but I have not used it extensively.  I have noticed, though, that Sibelius \nhas a plugin for &quot;quartertone playback&quot; that looks for quartertone accidentals (which \nsibelius supports but does not automatically play back) and sticks in the necessary \npitch bend.  I was thinking, couldn&#39;t someone (dangit I&#39;m probably volunteering \nagain) write plugins that would implement pitch bends in other tunings? 17, 19 and \neven 31 would be easy; you could even do unequal tunings as long as the notation \nyou want is limited to the normal plus quartertone accidentals. Anything else and I \nthink there would be trouble.  \n\nThe programming language is Sibelius&#39; own, they&#39;re apparently open to including \nplugins if they like what you send, and they say they&#39;ll even pay money for good ones!  \n(Maybe I don&#39;t need a summer job...)

If I could use \nthe fine bends I would. Even so, 1.56 cent accuracy is not too bad. \nBend 64, is of course the centre - no pitch deviation at all.\n\nI don&#39;t subscribe to Tuning anymore - too much to do to read yet more \nmails. I will say that the 46EDO representation I reject because its \nchromatic intervals in the 11 note scale are larger than the diatonic \nones, within that scale. The diatonic analogy is the 17EDO scale\n\n0 3 6 7 10 13 16 (0 where the chromatic shift is 2 and the diatonic is \n1 steps wide.\n\nAlternatives for 11 from 19 are 30, 41 and 49, etc. I leave these for \nthe theoretical minded to work out the pcs.\n\nMark\n\n\n"

However, \nthe standard seems to be to divide a semitone into 4096 parts, in \nother words 4096 pitch bends is a semitone; if there isn&#39;t anything \nsaying do otherwise that is what is assumed. If we look at the note \nnumbers and pitch bends in all four of your movements taken together \nand reduce it all to an octave, we get 20 combinations of note number \nand pitch bend, representing a chain of 19 fifths from -10 to +9, the \n0 being A 440. The -10 corresponds to the pair [71, 12544] and the +9 \nto [72, 4352]; these should represent the same note. Subtracting \ngives [1, -8192], which means 8192 pitch bends should be a semitone. \nIf I reset the pitch bend range on Audio Compositor it should then \nrender the file in 19-equal, but if I don&#39;t do that, or if someone \nplays the midi file in a midi player, I think we are off from what \nyou intended by a factor of two. That could be fixed by editing the \ntext version of the midi files and converting them back to binary.\n\n\n"

I set my \n&#39;zero&#39; on A, as that is the tuned pitch on the =\r\nreal recorders that \ncould play these pieces. If anyone is interested I can=\r\n post an &#39;ear \ntest&#39; Sibelius file which I put together when composing thes=\r\ne works. \nThere are slight deviations caused by the facts that:\n\n1 if a ben=\r\nd of 0 bends pitch down 1 semitone, then the semitone is \ndivided into 64 p=\r\narts.\n2. if a bend of 127 bends a pitch up by one semitone, then the range =\r\n65 \nto 127 must divide a semitone into 63.5 parts: my spreadsheet \ncomputat=\r\nions insist on this.  - I even typed out a big table of all 128 \nbends and =\r\ncomputed the cent values given 0 cents as a bend of 64 as \nabove.\n3. The gr=\r\nanularity of these bends is of the order of 1.5 cents, so the \nmaximum devi=\r\nation is half this:\n\nbend:\nk  &lt;---------------1.5625=A2------------------&gt; =\r\nk+1\n|----------------------------------------------|\n                      =\r\n  ^ max deviation =3D 0.78=A2 - movement either way \nwill make the represen=\r\ntation more accurate, not less.\n\nMark\n\n\n"

However,\n&gt; the standard seems to be to divide a semitone into 4096 parts, in\n&gt; other words 4096 pitch bends is a semitone; if there isn&#39;t anything\n&gt; saying do otherwise that is what is assumed. If we look at the note\n&gt; numbers and pitch bends in all four of your movements taken together\n&gt; and reduce it all to an octave, we get 20 combinations of note number\n&gt; and pitch bend, representing a chain of 19 fifths from -10 to +9, the\n&gt; 0 being A 440. The -10 corresponds to the pair [71, 12544] and the +9\n&gt; to [72, 4352]; these should represent the same note. Subtracting\n&gt; gives [1, -8192], which means 8192 pitch bends should be a semitone.\n&gt; If I reset the pitch bend range on Audio Compositor it should then\n&gt; render the file in 19-equal, but if I don&#39;t do that, or if someone\n&gt; plays the midi file in a midi player, I think we are off from what\n&gt; you intended by a factor of two. That could be fixed by editing the\n&gt; text version of the midi files and converting them back to binary.\n\nYes, Gene is right.\n\nThe scheme that Mark describes is one where there is only one significant byte \n(midi byte that is, with the leading zero indicating that it is data) used to \nindicate bend. This low-res response is found on some models of synth  or \nsoftsynth.\n\nThe standard, however, is two midi bytes (14 bits) covering a range of two \nWHOLE steps (1 up from center, 1 down). This is 16384. Dividing by 4 to \naccount only for going one direction, and one semitone, gives us 4096.\n\nThen of course, bend signals are centered on 8192, so &#39;no bend&#39; being sent as \na pitch bend signal would be 8192 in decimal, and the hex would be \ndistributed over two bytes, each with leading zeros.\n\n\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

The interesting\nfeature i found is that if i start at one tempo of the Hexany and go around\nthe tempos as they lay out when mapped onto a flat hexagon, I get a very\nstrong feeling of &quot;tonality&quot; when i return to the original tempo.\n\n\ndaniel_anthony_stearns wrote:\n\n&gt; There&#39;s no doubt that drum machines are a kind of lowbrow offspring\n&gt; of the Rhythmicon, and in the piece I posted the tempo changes almost\n&gt; every measure strictly according to simple integer proportions\n&gt; (ratios).-- -Kraig Grady\n\nNorth American Embassy of Anaphoria Island\n http://www.anaphoria.com\nThe Wandering Medicine Show\n KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST\n\n\n"

I don&#39;t know where people get 4096 pitch bends per \n&gt; semitone:  sibelius is quite clear on this, the range is 0 to 127, with \n&gt; 64 being the centre: no pitch bend.\n\nI have no way of knowing what you are hearing; all I have is the midi\nfile, and how that is heard depends on how the pitch bends are\ninterpreted. In any case, I rendered the midi files using Audio\nCompositor set to a bend sensitivity of 8192 pitch bends to a\nsemitone, converted to ogg, and uploaded it. The ogg files and\ndiscussion of your scale on the web page should now be correct; it\nmight be a good idea for you to take a listen and see what you think.\n\nhttp://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/coll.htm\n\nI have to say this has all been highly educational.\n\n\n\n"

I&#39;ve checked against my own ear and \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; definitely used a 19-tone scale that is only marginally off EDO \n&gt; (limitations with Roland SC88 do not permit me from using the other \n&gt; pitch bend number ). I don&#39;t know where people get 4096 pitch bends \nper \n&gt; semitone:  sibelius is quite clear on this, the range is 0 to 127, \nwith \n&gt; 64 being the centre: no pitch bend. \n\n\n***As I understand it, the first bend number goes from 0 to 127.  \nThis is the &quot;fine&quot; number.  The &quot;coarse&quot; number is the *second* \nnumber after the comma.  So in other words, ~B127,127 is the largest \nbend you can have.  Since there are, essentially then, 128 bends for \nboth coarse and fine (including 0) you get 128 x 128 or 16384.\n\nNow since the bend range is over *two whole tones* or 4 semi-tones, \nyou have to divide by 4...\n\n16384/4 = 4096.\n\nbest,\n\nJ.

The idea is to toss N dice, and sum them on each &#39;round&#39;, but only \nroll the Xth die every X^2 round (where the dice are X from 0-N).\n\nI took the idea further by making an algorithm that would create a melody that \nwould be the &#39;sum of itself&#39; on different time scales, analogous to the way \nthat pink noise could be emulated by summing die rolls that &#39;moved&#39; on \ndifferent time scales, giving the resulting melody(s) a &#39;self-similar&#39; or \nfractal feel.\n\nThe xentonality for this piece is mild; here I use the &#39;Equable Diatonic&#39; \nscale of Ptolemy (1/1 10/9 11/9 4/3 3/2 5/3 11/6 2/1) which is so-called for \nits most even superparticular 3-part division of the tetrachord...\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

So, if the pitch \nbend range of your synth can&#39;t be altered then the pitch-bends will be \nwrong.  But the range I set my bends to was 1 semitone, so the range \ndivides 200 cents into 128 parts, and bend 127 up does /not/ bend up by \na semitone, but just short of it (63.5/64 of it to be precise, this is \ndue to the asymmetry of the range)\n\nPich bends are only 14 bits in all. but All SC88 can alter is the MS \nbits. But I can alter the pb range, so I do. If your synth doesn&#39;t do \nthis then your synth isn&#39;t compliant with the standard. My synth \ndoesn&#39;t comply because it doesn&#39;t recognise the lower 7 bits, well not \nto my ear.\n\nThat&#39;s all folks.\n\nMark\n\nOn Monday, May 10, 2004, at 05:52  am, MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com \nwrote:\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Philippe\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"

Often I prefer\narrangements with 24 notes per octave where both keyboards have the\nsame pattern of steps and intervals and are placed at some convenient\ndistance apart. A general diagram, with an asterisk (*) representing\nthe distance between the keyboards in a given system, might look like\nthis:\n\n\n        C#*     Eb*             F#*     G#*    Bb*\n  C*         D         E    F       G       A        B    C\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n        C#      Eb              F#      G#     Bb\n  C          D         E    F       G       A        B    C\n\nFor example, this scheme could use two 12-note Pythagorean tunings at\na 64:63 or 7:6 apart, to get some pure ratios like 7:6, 9:7, and 7:4.\nAnother example is two 12-note sets in some shade of meantone\ntemperament, for example 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma, at a distance of what\nis called an &quot;enharmonic diesis&quot; -- the difference in a given\ntemperament, for example, between G# and Ab. One favorite illustration\nof mine is Peppermint, with two 12-note sets of a regular temperament\nwith fifths at around 704.10 cents (about 2.14 cents wide) placed at a\ndistance of about 58.680 cents.\n\nWith a tuning set of 13-17 notes per octave, I use an arrangement\nsomewhat analogous to 15th-18th century European keyboards with &quot;split\nkey accidentals&quot; -- that is, with a black key divided into two parts,\nso that the front portion produces G# and the back portion Ab, for\nexample. A &quot;conventional&quot; -- for me -- example, is my standard layout\nfor a 17-note system dividing each whole-tone into three diatonic\nsemitones or thirdtones, which I&#39;ve used for 17-equal or 17-tET,\nunequal well-temperaments, and also a just system called JOT-17:\n\n                Db       D#       Gb     Ab      A#\n              C      D      E   F      G      A     B   C\n              -------------------------------------------\n                  C#   Eb           F#     G#   Bb\n              C      D      E   F      G      A     B   C\n\nThese models can also be adapted to what I might call, for me,\nsomewhat less &quot;conventional&quot; tunings, where you can&#39;t form a 2:1\noctave from five identical whole-tones plus two identical semitones.\nFor example, here&#39;s a mapping for 20-equal, based on two keyboards\nwith identical patterns at 2 scale steps apart:\n\n        5     7         13    15     18\n   2       6     9  10     14     17      21  22\n -------------------------------------------------\n        3     5         11    13     16\n   0       4     7  8      12     15      19  20\n\nHere&#39;s an arrangement for 14-equal where only two of the accidental\nkeys vary between the two keyboards, with the other notes the same on\nboth:\n\n     1    4       7   9    12\n  0    2    5  6    8    11   13  14\n-------------------------------------\n     1   3        7    10  12\n  0    2    5  6    8    11   13  14\n\nPlease let me emphasize that a choice of layouts can reflect the\ninterval preferences or stylistic leanings of the person doing the\nlayout, and also that these solutions might be considered rather crude\ncompared to a generalized keyboard, for example, with up to 53 or more\nnotes per octave.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

I like it because it\n&gt; seems to work better than mp3, and has the advantage of being patent\n&gt; free and open source, which deflects potential problems. \n\nI did some research on .mp3 vs .ogg. I might consider migrating to .ogg, \nbecause it&#39;s consistent with my open source philosophy (I use Linux). It&#39;s \nfile sizes are generally smaller than mp3&#39;s, and I can hear no difference in \naudio quality between an ogg file and an mp3 at a given bitrate. I did hear a \ndifference between them with a 128kbps, constant-bit rate mp3, and a \n128kbps-average, variable-bit-rate ogg. The ogg was crisper, with clearer \nhigh-end, but I think I could get similar quality out of an mp3 with the \nwrite command-line switches on the LAME encoder. \n\nHowever, this was hardly &#39;scientific&#39;. The default variable-bit algorithm \n(VBR) for &#39;oggenc&#39; allows one to specify an average bit-rate, where the VBR \noption on &#39;lame&#39; (the linux mp3 encoder) is an abstract &#39;quality&#39; parameter. \nSo, the problem with making an ABX comparison in my case is that it&#39;s hard to \ntell what command line switches for &#39;oggenc&#39; and &#39;lame&#39; are close in quality, \nall else being equal. So, I was comparing a fixed-bitrate mp3 (the &#39;lame&#39; \ndefault) with a variable-bitrate ogg (which averages, but sometimes exceeds, \nthe same fixed rate of the mp3), giving the ogg an advantage. Perhaps the \ntrue test would be to make the highest quality .mp3 and .ogg files possible, \nand do the ABX comparison from those. I doubt any discernible difference \ncould be heard at all, though, because at the highest bitrates, both would be \nindistinguishable from CD audio....\n\nSo for me the only differences are file size, where ogg has a slight \nadvantage; open source, where ogg has the better philosophy for me, and \nubiquitousness, where mp3 has a distinct lead. I think that can be fixed by a \nhealthy public campaign for ogg files, but there a lot of inertia in the \nindustry because of things like iPod, etc. But I&#39;d just as soon make people \ndownload software for a free format, as they make me download things for \ntheir proprietary (Windoze-based) formats! I think Real Audio sucks, and \nsounds like AM radio most of the time. Maybe its just what default setting \npeople tend to use. BTW, how does one *encode* to .ra or .ram from .wav?\n\n...perhaps I&#39;ll start making ogg files, and do my part to push the industry to \ndoing the right thing, and helping ogg mature.....\n\nSorry if this is considered by some to be off-topic for this list ;) I at \nleast consider it as on-topic as say, softsynths. We all tend to share our \nmusic in compressed audio formats, after all, so its worth figuring things \nout and comparing notes...\n\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

I&#39;d love to continue a theory conversation with you \n*somewhere*, though, if even in private e-mail -- all I know is that \nthis isn&#39;t the place for it. But I will mix a little theory in below, \nso I apologize to all.\n\n&gt; I will say that the 46EDO representation I reject because its \n&gt; chromatic intervals in the 11 note scale are larger than the \ndiatonic \n&gt; ones, within that scale. The diatonic analogy is the 17EDO scale\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 3 6 7 10 13 16 (0 where the chromatic shift is 2 and the diatonic \nis \n&gt; 1 steps wide.\n\nI just want to say that diatonic melodies, even ones that modulate, \nsound absolutely beautiful to me in 17-equal. This is based on \nlistening to Blackwood and playing myself, but I know George and \nMargo agree. Harmony is precarious at best but the melodic and \nmodulatory properties sound close to ideal to me -- or at least they \nevoke some powerful feelings in my heart. Historically and \ngeographically, the diatonic scale in Pythagorean tuning has been \nvery important, despite the fact that its chromatic semitone is \nslightly larger than its diatonic semitone.\n\nWith the semisixths[11] scale, I have a lot less experience, but \nsemisixths came up as an interesting temperament for 5-limit harmony \nand one of the three or four *most* interesting for 7-limit. It looks \nto me as if, either way, the harmonically optimal tuning is such that \n19-, 27-, and 46-tone &#39;generalized diatonic&#39; scales from this \ntemperament have large step : small step approximately in the golden \nratio. The 11-tone scale, though, has harmonically optimal steps of \n131 and 50 cents; one mode is \n131+50+131+131+131+50+131+131+131+50+131. On Wednesday, I&#39;m going to \ntry to mess with this *melodically* and see if it doesn&#39;t evoke any \nfeelings for me.\n\nHopefully I&#39;ll also have some 15-equal lunacy to share with the list \nat that point.\n\n\n"

Your algorithms are again producing\n&gt; very organic results. I&#39;d love to discuss this algorithm further --\n&gt; could you give some more specific details? Anyway, this was a nice\n&gt; arabic/indian/electronica piece, the alternating timbres were a nice\n&gt; egyptian touch too. Tasty.\n\nThanks, Paul !\n\nThe algorithm in this case is what I call a &#39;self-similar melody&#39; algorithm \nthat I developed myself.\n\nThe idea is to take a motif, represented as a set of integers. For example \n[2,4,3,1], which is a four note &#39;motif&#39; . Actually, this &#39;motif&#39; is randomly \ndetermined by my algorithm as the role of a six sided die, done p times, \nwhere p is the seed phrase length.\n\nThen, there is a depth parameter to the algorithm, so I can decide to have X \nmelodic strands added together. Let&#39;s make it 3 for example. Melodic Strand X \nwill advance every 2^X steps, and each melodic strand will be summed at every \nstep to give an &#39;output melody&#39;:\n\n2+2+2 = 6 \n4+2+2 = 8\n3+4+2 = 9\n1+4+2 = 7\n2+3+4 = 9\n4+3+4 = 11\n3+1+4 = 8\n1+1+4 = 6\n\nAs you can see, at the slowest level of melody strand 3, ...(yes, I did this \nreverse of traditional positional notation--the least significant, fastest \nmoving strand is represented here as the leftmost, not rightmost, column)\n...on the rightmost column above, it hasn&#39;t used all of the seed phrase array \n[2,4,3,1], only going as far as [2,4] because the depth parameter was 3, and \nthe melody length will always be 2^d, where d is the depth parameter.\n\nThe above &#39;melody&#39; [6,8,9,7,9,11,8,6] is then scaled from zero to a \n&#39;scale_max&#39; parameter, which is determined from a mapping to a set of notes.\nFor instance if the scale were 6 notes large [0-5], the above melody would \nbecome [0,2,3,1,3,5,2,0]. If the range were larger or smaller, a \nmultiplication would take place for every element in the array as well.\n\nI find the results of such an algorithm fairly musical, but sometimes in need \nof a human touch.\n\nI hope that explains everything...\n\n-Aaron.\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Aaron K.

Your algorithms are again \nproducing\n&gt; &gt; very organic results. I&#39;d love to discuss this algorithm further -\n-\n&gt; &gt; could you give some more specific details? Anyway, this was a nice\n&gt; &gt; arabic/indian/electronica piece, the alternating timbres were a \nnice\n&gt; &gt; egyptian touch too. Tasty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, Paul !\n&gt; \n&gt; The algorithm in this case is what I call a &#39;self-similar melody&#39; \nalgorithm \n&gt; that I developed myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea is to take a motif, represented as a set of integers. For \nexample \n&gt; [2,4,3,1], which is a four note &#39;motif&#39; . Actually, this &#39;motif&#39; is \nrandomly \n&gt; determined by my algorithm as the role of a six sided die, done p \ntimes, \n&gt; where p is the seed phrase length.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, there is a depth parameter to the algorithm, so I can decide \nto have X \n&gt; melodic strands added together. Let&#39;s make it 3 for example. \nMelodic Strand X \n&gt; will advance every 2^X steps,\n\nIs the number 2 here related to the number p mentioned above? Or is \nit an additional variable? Or do you always use 2?\n\n&gt; and each melodic strand will be summed at every \n&gt; step to give an &#39;output melody&#39;:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2+2+2 = 6 \n&gt; 4+2+2 = 8\n&gt; 3+4+2 = 9\n&gt; 1+4+2 = 7\n&gt; 2+3+4 = 9\n&gt; 4+3+4 = 11\n&gt; 3+1+4 = 8\n&gt; 1+1+4 = 6\n&gt; \n&gt; As you can see, at the slowest level of melody strand 3, ...(yes, I \ndid this \n&gt; reverse of traditional positional notation--the least significant, \nfastest \n&gt; moving strand is represented here as the leftmost, not rightmost, \ncolumn)\n&gt; ...on the rightmost column above, it hasn&#39;t used all of the seed \nphrase array \n&gt; [2,4,3,1], only going as far as [2,4] because the depth parameter \nwas 3, and \n&gt; the melody length will always be 2^d, where d is the depth \nparameter.\n&gt; \n&gt; The above &#39;melody&#39; [6,8,9,7,9,11,8,6] is then scaled from zero to a \n&gt; &#39;scale_max&#39; parameter, which is determined from a mapping to a set \nof notes.\n&gt; For instance if the scale were 6 notes large [0-5], the above \nmelody would \n&gt; become [0,2,3,1,3,5,2,0]. If the range were larger or smaller, a \n&gt; multiplication would take place for every element in the array as \nwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find the results of such an algorithm fairly musical, but \nsometimes in need \n&gt; of a human touch.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that explains everything...\n\nSo if I hear notes of longer duration in the output melody, is that \nbecause a certain number is repeated in the defining string?\n\n\n"

What _Xentonality_ demonstrates in most creative ways is\nthat tuning/timbre matching can not only generate some interestingly\nconsonant intervals; it can serve as a basic for beautiful music.\n\nOf course, as Bill himself would emphasize, this isn&#39;t the first such\ndemonstration, and the principle manifests itself in various world\nmusics: but as Aaron Johnson has aptly written, _Xentonality_ is\nindeed a collection of &quot;etudes&quot; in the science and art of harmonizing\ntuning and timbre (or vice versa).\n\nIndeed, in my own idiomatic vocabulary, _Sethareanize_ has become a\nvery useful verb, meaning basically &quot;to experiment with timbre and\ntuning, or to make music based on such experimenting.&quot; Likewise,\n_Sethareanization_ means the process of &quot;well-timbrement,&quot; or\naccording tuning and timbre. Of course, one might also name such a\npractice after the masterful builders of African xylophones, or\nJavanese or Balinese gamelan instruments, or such xenharmonicists as\nIvor Darreg, John Chowning, and Wendy Carlos; but my usage might\nreflect Bill&#39;s role as an explicator and exemplar of this process.\n\nWhat I can definitely say is that &quot;Sethareanization&quot; is a contagious\nexercise: I&#39;m writing this after having devised a tuning/timbre\ncombination for a new (to me) temperament, and am writing in the\nafterglow of an exhilarating process. Part of the fun of listening to\n_Xentonality_ is the element of empathy: &quot;How might I, or have I,\napproached this same tuning?&quot;\n\nHere I&#39;ll seek to complement Aaron&#39;s fine review by addressing a few\ntracks of special interest to me in a CD album where every piece\noffers inspiration to listeners and musicmakers alike.\n\nHow could I resist a gorgeous piece like _Seventeen Strings_, given my\nlove for quintal/quartal harmony (chords built with fifths or\nfourths)? Here Bill has taken a beautiful harp texture and customized\nthe timbre to 17-tET. While I might guess that the timbral adjustment\nwas done in part to get &quot;smoother&quot; or less tense thirds, I might ask\nwhether the fifths and fourths (about 3.93 cents respectively wide and\nnarrow of a pure 3:2 or 4:3) were also made to seem closer to just, as\nfor example in a Pythagorean tuning.\n\nWhatever Bill has done in technical terms, those arpeggiated\nsonorities in fifth and fourths are really beautiful, and the portions\nwith more emphasis on thirds indeed have a &quot;smooth and pleasant&quot;\nquality, a judgment which I might guess a listener less accustomed to\nthe rather active or &quot;beatful&quot; thirds and sixths in this portion of\nthe spectrum -- when played in typical harmonic timbres -- might\nshare.\n\nBy the way, a tuning like 17-tET can also illustrate how the nuances\nof &quot;Sethareanization&quot; may vary according to style. The major third in\nthis temperament, at about 423.53 cents, seems near the point of\nmaximum complexity or tension between the simple ratios of 5:4\n(~386.31 cents) and 9:7 (~435.08 cents), so that in many timbres the\neffect can sound decidedly &quot;dissonant.&quot; In a medieval or neo-medieval\nEuropean style where thirds and sixths are active and unstable, a bit\nof discretion in choosing a timbre can help to achieve the desired\neffect of &quot;imperfect&quot; or _partial_ concord.\n\nHowever, as _Xentonality_ shows, it&#39;s also possible to adapt 17-tET to\nstyles where thirds and sixths are fully concordant, and moreover to\ndo so in a delightfully rich texture based on an artfully modified\nCeltic harp sample.\n\nA characteristically urbane side of Bill&#39;s music comes out in _Unlucky\nFlutes_, which I might describe as a kind of jazz ensemble piece in\n13-tET -- or, at least, I find the style somehow &quot;jazzy,&quot; an adjective\nI also apply to some of my favorite 14th-century music. Here, as in\nmuch jazz, the melody is a big attraction, and the &quot;bass&quot; line adds to\nthe charm.\n\nAs stated in the notes: &quot;All instruments clearly retain their tonal\nidentity, yet sound harmonious even on sustained passages.&quot; As someone\nwho has borrowed and designed some timbres for 13-tET on the Yahama\nTX-802 FM synthesizer, I can say that meeting both parts of that\nstatement at the same time -- getting a &quot;harmonious&quot; sound with a\nmixed ensemble of &quot;flutes, guitars, bass, and keyboard&quot; -- is indeed\nimpressive. My own more technically modest approach has been simply to\nborrow or concoct a texture or two that to my ears make the interval\nof 8/13 octave (about 738.46 cents) sound like a reasonably persuasive\nand concordant &quot;fifth,&quot; and go from there.\n\nThe result of Bill&#39;s technical achievement is something that reminds\nme of a jazz ensemble from around the 1960&#39;s: witty, cultured, and\nmusically most engaging.\n\nAs it happens, two pieces on this CD tie in with one of my first\nintroductions to Bill Sethares and his timbre/tuning creations:\nhearing some of the customized electronic &quot;instruments&quot; he designed\nfor Gary Morrison&#39;s 88-cET or &quot;88-cent equal temperament&quot; on a\ncassette which Morrison kindly sent me offering a kind of guided tour\nof this tuning. I recall that Bill designed a &quot;bagpipes&quot; timbre, for\nexample, fit to one of the possible quasi-octave intervals of this\ntuning, either 1144 cents or 1232 cents.\n\n_Haroun in 88_ has a flavor I again find &quot;jazzy,&quot; and I might say\n&quot;upbeat,&quot; with nice counterpoint. There&#39;s a richness to the harmony\nand texture which _might_ reflect the stretched-octave tuning, but\nalso more generally the thematic interchange and interplay between the\nvoices, something effective in lots of tuning systems and styles. If\nasked to propose an ostentatiously &quot;88-cET&quot; scenario, I might suggest\nsome gamelan-like texture with an accent on shimmering 1232-cent\nquasi-octaves. This seems to me rather more subtle, with an affability\nand refinement that might suggest jazz or Blues.\n\nAlso in 88-cET, the companion piece _88 Vibes_ has indeed what I might\ncall a &quot;vibrant&quot; quality, using a spectrally mapped &quot;vibraphone&quot;\ntimbre. As I wrote in my notes, this piece has a &quot;brightness and\nmystery&quot; about it; there are some effects like glissando sweeps to\ncatch the ear, and a lyrical theme with a chord progression I&#39;m almost\ntempted to compare to a hypothetical version in minor of the Beatles&#39;\n_Let it Be_. Possibly this last comparison might give caution about my\nopinions concerning a wide range of post-1400 music, but the\nimpression of something &quot;different, and yet not that unfamiliar&quot; is\nworth noting.\n\nNow we come to the other piece I&#39;m reviewing here, and which has given\nme cause for a bit of cursory Web research on the sociocultural\nbackground: _The Turquoise Dabo Girl_ in 11-tET. My first association\non seeing this title around the time I was first getting in touch with\nBill Sethares on the Internet was with the Latin phrase _Ibi dabo\ntibi_ (&quot;There I will give you...&quot;) from the motet _Quam pulchra es_ by\nthe English composer John Dunstable (c. 1370?-1453).\n\nA Dabo girl, as it turns out, is a woman in the science fiction series\n_Deep Space Nine_ who operates the wheel for a game of chance called\nDabo, apparently some futuristic variant of roulette.[1] It&#39;s not an\nespecially high-status position to occupy, and the main role\nexpectation is to attract and hold the interest of as many gambling\ncustomers as possible, using just about any alluring means to do so.\n\nHowever, the role of Dabo girl does not necessarily define the woman\n(from whatever solar system) playing it: &quot;today a Dabo girl, tomorrow\nthe leader of an interplanetary liberation movement.&quot;\n\nApproaching the piece from this perspective, I might hear in _The\nTurquoise Dabo Girl_ both the exotic and alluring atmosphere of a\n_Deep Space Nine_ casino, and the inner character and strength of a\nperson who finds herself in the role of a Dabo girl, but has lots of\nthings to express beyond that role.\n\nThe opening portion might accentuate more the &quot;exotic&quot; theme: I found\nit &quot;a bit `brooding,&#39; but not necessarily unfriendly.&quot; One comparison\nevoked my childhood: how about using this as a neat theme in the late\n1950&#39;s or early 1960&#39;s for a mystery series on television, or a movie,\nabout some sophisticated investigators, like _The Thin Man_ or _The\nPink Panther_?\n\nThen things get more lyrically, I might say yearningly, concordant --\nnot that the previous effect was &quot;dissonant.&quot; Paul Erlich once\nconcluded, if I recall correctly, and my own experiments with 11-tET\nseem to confirm, that this harmonic sweetness results in part from the\nuse of a sonority like 0-6-9-13 steps or about 0-655-983-1418 cents.\nThe effect, like that of a just 4:6:7:9 (~0-702-969-1404 cents) or\nsome closer tempered approximation, is a resonant and intriguingly\ncomplex concord. As Paul Erlich has noted, having a multi-voice chord\nfitting this kind of pattern can compensate for inaccuracies in the\ntuning of individual intervals, like the 11-tET fifth -- at around 655\ncents, some 47 cents narrow of a just 3:2, and inviting the more\nlikely description of a large tritone (e.g. 16:11, around 649 cents).\n\nIn more conventional terms, 0-6-9-13 steps could be described as a\nvery narrow fifth, small minor seventh, and rather wide major ninth;\nin Bill&#39;s spectrally mapped &quot;instrumentation,&quot; this can convey a\n&quot;minor seventh&quot; flavor fitting with an aura of &quot;cool&quot; and\nsophisticated harmony a la the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s.\n\nOne question which Bill himself asks in his notes about a &quot;pan flute&quot;\nmelody harmonized in the &quot;chorus&quot; of the piece: &quot;Does this have the\nfeeling of some kind of (perhaps unfamiliar) `cadence&#39; as the melody\nresolves back to its `tonic&#39;?&quot;\n\nMy own answer would be &quot;Yes, and rather like a remissive or Phrygian\ncadence; at least, I pick up the ascending `whole-tone&#39; motion in one\nor some of the upper voices (by a 2-step interval of around 218 cents,\nI&#39;d guess), and this suggests to me an effect like descending motion\nin some other voice by a `semitone&#39; of one step, or around 109 cents.&quot;\n\nAs I might cheerfully conclude by cautioning again, Sethareanizing can\nbe a highly contagious participant sport, and these consummate etudes,\nas Aaron has well described them, provide an incentive and inspiration\nfor others of us who seek to emulate his most subtle art.\n\n----\nNote\n----\n\n1. While I tend to regard my free association of &quot;Dabo girl&quot; with\nDunstable&#39;s setting of the words _Ibi dabo tibi_ as fortuitous, one\nunofficial explanation of the name &quot;Dabo&quot; indeed derives it from the Latin\n_dabo_, &quot;I shall give&quot; -- as in an advertisement of sorts: &quot;Look at the\nprizes we&#39;re giving out if you pick the right number!&quot;  Another unofficial\nderivation is from a proper name. I&#39;m not sure if the creators of _Deep\nSpace Nine_ have spoken to this question.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

However, my\nmain deprivation is not being able to hear _other_ people&#39;s music made\navailable here in computer formats, a gift to our community\nsupplementing CD&#39;s which I can and should get (e.g. Aaron Johnson).\nThere&#39;s a spontaneity in being able to post and share these files,\nwhether of &quot;works in progress&quot; or of finished pieces, that can inform,\neducate, and inspire our creative energy all around.\n\nAlso, as to what I&#39;m doing here, what I&#39;d call timbrally sensitive\ntunings and pieces can sometimes be a special source of frustration\nwhen it comes to this sharing process. If I had a means of promptly\nrecording and posting my experiments, I&#39;d be doing this right now for\n14-tET and also another very exciting tuning that has made me look at\ndiatonic or &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot; semitones from a new viewpoint, possibly\nconfirming some tendencies of which certain people are aware.\n\nIf I could record digitally from synthesizer to CD, and also to an\naudio file format, that would solve the problem of getting my music\nout there. A sound card and audio software for MS-DOS 6.22, or a\n32-bit DOS-based environment such as DJGPP, would solve the listening\nproblem. However, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s out there for MS-DOS -- or for a\ncommand-line UNIX-compatible OS and environment (Linux?). Since with\nDJGPP I&#39;m already accustomed to lots of UNIX-like commands, I should\nat least mention the latter option.\n\nAt least with a piece like the one which Rick and Gene have so\ngenerously made available, I can play it on synthesizer, and indeed\nwould like to get my keyboard interpretation out there in an audio\nfile and eventually on CD -- the latter, especially, leaving room for\na lot of practice, perfecting, and general refinement of my keyboard\ntechnique.\n\nOf course, even with such a piece, the more renditions and\ninstrumentations I hear, the better, both to appreciate what I&#39;ve done\nand to consider what I might do.\n\nThank you, Gene and Rick, for your help in making my piece available\nto lots of listeners; and Jon, for your support in considering the\nproblem of how I might better hear what others are doing here, and\nalso share my music online.\n\nMost appreciatively, with many thanks,\n\nMargo\nmschulter@...\n\n"

It would be nice for someone to mock this up \nin another synth/sample/whatever format to get an even smoother phrasing.\n\nBut this is just an example, and I already realize that there are stumbling \nblocks that might not be able to be overcome. OTOH, I can&#39;t believe that \nwe&#39;ve come to the point where we can create a microtonal piece, but have it \nlocked into a convoluted form (i.e. doing pitch bends across multiple midi \nchannels) that refuses to release it&#39;s musical information for further \ndevelopment.\n\nNo need for immediate answers, let&#39;s just all think about this...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Do you feel there would be value in that?\n\nWould that be simply another rendering? If so, I don&#39;t think much would \nchange, read below...\n\n&gt;Midi serves as a kind of technical bottleneck and a lot of the persistent \n&gt;problems come from there.\n\nIn a way, yes, but not always. One of the reasons multi-channel things are \ndifficult, *unless* there is a way to play/program in the individual \nmusical lines first (and do inflection/editing then) is that you can&#39;t put \nit all back into one musical line that you could contour. You can&#39;t edit \ncontroller data to inflect either the color or volume or [insert synth \nparameter here] so that you have musical control over the line. And if \nTimidity is just going to render again with Soundfonts, you don&#39;t get \nanything to alter the repeated vocal attacks of the choir (unless you can \ncome up with a layered, velocity-sensitive font, and go in and edit the \nmidi velocity data).\n\nBut maybe it would fix the scoops.\n\nMIDI is as much a bottleneck as one allows it to be, and this is an \ninstance (unless you want to go straight to recording live, acoustic \ninstruments, or program Csound like Prent) where there pretty much isn&#39;t an \nalternative. If people are going to work in the electronic world (and it \n*really* pains me that [currently] acoustic musics are taking a back seat, \nif a seat at all, on MMM), then one needs to look at the entire panorama of \noptions. These, naturally, include playing/programming individual lines, \nmixing them how one wants, freezing/rendering to audio, and then bringing \nthat audio back into the piece as one track. You can turn midi into \nmultiple-track audio recording, and have a lot of control over the mix over \na long period of time.\n\nYes, it is a lot of work, and some people don&#39;t like to make music that way \n(and I&#39;d never force them). But I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time in the \nlast week doing dedicated research on some of this, for my own selfish \npurposes :) and that includes buy recordings and magazines and a lot of \ntime online. There is some hellaciously cool stuff going on, and the amount \nof control a composer can have right now - assuming you can live without \nhiring an A-list orchestra to record your next microtonal symphonic cycle - \nis getting near nirvana.\n\nEspecially mixing down to 5.1 surround...\n\nMore anon,\nJon\n\n\n"

But it would be either while or after I actually do it. Until I&#39;m \nactually composing/performing/recording, it is hard to say what I&#39;ll do, \nmuch less *how* I&#39;ll do it. For the moment, let&#39;s say that what interests \nme is (currently) the creation of audio environments/works that are both \nmore than, and less than, pieces of music.\n\nI also note that while I spend a lot of my life in the acoustic realm, \nthere are things that have long fascinated me, and given me fertile ground, \nin the realm of electronic and processed sound that simply doesn&#39;t exist in \nthe real world. And while a lot of ground-breaking work has been done in \nacademic electronic circles, what motivates me about a million times more \nare the current trends in popular electronica and related musics. Killing \ntime between bass drum interruptions at &quot;La Traviata&quot; I was reading the \nlatest issue of &quot;Electronic Musician&quot; and came across an article about BT \n(a young musician who not only was a seminal trance artist, but has crossed \nover to film, having recently scored &quot;Monster&quot;).\n\nHe spoke about issues in creating music in this realm (not coincidentally \ntalking about having ditched almost every piece of music hardware for \nsoftware), and some of his ideas were so damned intriguing I had to check \nit out. I got his latest recording, &quot;Emotional Technology&quot;. And that sucker \nis doing things with music, and with sound, that I have longed to do for years.\n\nI haven&#39;t been blown away like this for years, but hey, it&#39;s just me. I \ndon&#39;t know that it would hit other people this way at all, especially in \nour more classical audience.\n\n&gt;My attempts to fix Bodacious Breed have so far sounded lame to me.\n\nI can&#39;t remember what state this is in. If, in order to achieve a given \ntuning, a single musical entity (i.e. melody line, counterpoint line, \nchordal progression) is split up onto multiple midi channels, I currently \ncan&#39;t figure how to get that kind of stuff massaged into the kind of \nexpression I happen to hear in pieces (re: my recent musing about &quot;reverse \nengineering&quot;).\n\nMore on all this later. Time stretches before me...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Szanto wrote:\n\n&gt; One of the reasons multi-channel things are\n&gt; difficult, *unless* there is a way to play/program in the individual\n&gt; musical lines first (and do inflection/editing then) is that you can&#39;t put\n&gt; it all back into one musical line that you could contour. You can&#39;t edit\n&gt; controller data to inflect either the color or volume or [insert synth\n&gt; parameter here] so that you have musical control over the line. And if\n&gt; Timidity is just going to render again with Soundfonts, you don&#39;t get\n&gt; anything to alter the repeated vocal attacks of the choir (unless you can\n&gt; come up with a layered, velocity-sensitive font, and go in and edit the\n&gt; midi velocity data).\n&gt;\n&gt; But maybe it would fix the scoops.\n&gt;\n&gt; MIDI is as much a bottleneck as one allows it to be, and this is an\n&gt; instance (unless you want to go straight to recording live, acoustic\n&gt; instruments, or program Csound like Prent) where there pretty much isn&#39;t an\n&gt; alternative. If people are going to work in the electronic world (and it\n&gt; *really* pains me that [currently] acoustic musics are taking a back seat,\n&gt; if a seat at all, on MMM), then one needs to look at the entire panorama of\n&gt; options. These, naturally, include playing/programming individual lines,\n&gt; mixing them how one wants, freezing/rendering to audio, and then bringing\n&gt; that audio back into the piece as one track. You can turn midi into\n&gt; multiple-track audio recording, and have a lot of control over the mix over\n&gt; a long period of time.\n\nI assume there are economic and practical reasons for this. Electronics makes \nit a hell of a lot easier to explore a *wide* variety of tunings very \naccurately and easily. Fixed pitch metallophones, refretting guitars, etc. is \nfantastic, but required $$$, plus the skills of possibly learning a new \ninstrument. Not to mention requiring extra space for storage, etc. which is \nmore $$$...\n\nI find the physical modelling trend promising, because like you Jon, I find \nmost sythetic timbres tied to MIDI very limiting (unless one can play a live \nline with some expression, but even then...) Hardware physical modelling \nsynths are still quite &#39;spensive, though, so for me, I&#39;m using RTSynth for \nLinux. It&#39;s range of timbres is small, but it makes up for it by being so \npotentially expressive sounding.\n\nYes, CSound is cool, but probably the hardest way to go, unless you have \ndeveloped a macro system, or front end, like Prent Rodgers. I found myself \nfrustrated by the hand-coding of CSound, and really have sworn it off, even \nthough I&#39;m amazed from time to time what Prent and others are able to do with \nit. To me, it far too slow a process, and I get really batty trying to wait \nfor the results---type, compile, listen, type, compile, listen, type, \ncompile, listen ----- *AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH* !!!!!!!!\n\nOne of the reasons I favor 12-note xentonal scales is not being stuck to MIDI \nthat I have to &#39;massage&#39; into expressivity--I can play it myself live, now, \nwith my current setup, and not a new investment of cash. Of course, I&#39;d love \na &#39;Continuum&#39; or whatever, but right now my wife and I have plenty more \npressing expenses on our plate !!!!\n\nBTW, one of the directions I want to go is similar to what you described, Jon: \na particular kind of ambient music not yet heard, but that I hear in my head. \nIt would be realized at this point by multitracking my Korg MS-2000, \nhand-picking and/or morphing the best timbres of that instument.\n\nOTOH, interesting things can happen if you hand code/algorithmitize MIDI \nmicrotonal works. As long as there are some volume level (attack) changes and \nsubtle timbres, good things *can* come of it. I coded a step sequencer that \nbecame more interesting by 10-fold once I coded attack level control into \neach step. It makes it sound much much more human.\n\nI have a feeling that MIDI sounds sterile more because of this than because \nthe time is so steady. In fact, unless it&#39;s at the very subtlest level, I get \nvery annoyed hearing an unsteady tempo (and I don&#39;t mean expressive things \nlike rubato--those I like--I mean a performance with &#39;bad time&#39;)\n\n&gt; Yes, it is a lot of work, and some people don&#39;t like to make music that way\n&gt; (and I&#39;d never force them). But I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time in the\n&gt; last week doing dedicated research on some of this, for my own selfish\n&gt; purposes :) and that includes buy recordings and magazines and a lot of\n&gt; time online. There is some hellaciously cool stuff going on, and the amount\n&gt; of control a composer can have right now - assuming you can live without\n&gt; hiring an A-list orchestra to record your next microtonal symphonic cycle -\n&gt; is getting near nirvana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Especially mixing down to 5.1 surround...\n\nLooking foward to you future contributions, Jon !\n\nAnd you are right, if one has patience to be anally retentive, one gets the \nbest results...\n\nBest,\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Fourth Street (between Washington \nSquare Eas=\r\nt and Greene Street).\n\nWe will be featuring tenor Paul Sperry in the jazz-h=\r\nued, French-\ninfluenced, Five Songs by the early 20th-century American comp=\r\noser \nTheodore Chanler, as well as Leonard Lehrman&#39;s Five Duets for soprano=\r\n \nHelene Williams, tenor and piano which explore the range of Lehrman&#39;s \nex=\r\npressive language. &quot;I Went Looking For My Soul,&quot; #3 of the 5 duets, \nbased =\r\non a poem by Charles Bernstein, will receive its world \npremiere.  \n\nCompos=\r\ner John Eaton will be in the audience for his Fantasy Romance \nfor cello an=\r\nd piano as rendered by Jeffrey Shaw, cello and Paul \nHoffmann, piano.  Eato=\r\nn, recipient of the 1990 MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; \naward is a master and pioneer =\r\nof the use of microtones, and here, \nlike a living genie, he integrates the=\r\nm into a mysterious and \narresting musical fabric.\n\nClarinetist Esther Lamn=\r\neck will showcase a new piece by Patrick \nHardish for solo clarinet, Sonori=\r\nties VII, one in his continuing \nseries of reflections on the sound possibi=\r\nlities and distinctive \ntimbres of individual instruments.\n\nComposers Conco=\r\nrdance mentor and advisor, the distinguished American \ncomposer Otto Luenin=\r\ng, will be remembered through his famous \nelectronic piece Gargoyles, for v=\r\niolin and tape, performed by the \nmasterful new music enthusiast, violinist=\r\n Lynn Bechtold, with audio \nsupport by Luening disciple, composer Dan Coope=\r\nr.  A mainstay of \nthe &quot;classical electronic&quot; literature, Gargoyles evidenc=\r\nes Luening&#39;s \nconcern with taking traditional forms and instruments into th=\r\ne &quot;space \nage=85&quot;\n\nContinuing our new electronic directions in sound, percu=\r\nssionist-\ncomposer Tom Beyer will premiere a piece RE  which explores his \n=\r\nmastery of the electronic idiom while showing his performing prowess \nas pe=\r\nrcussionist.\n\nAnd, the percussion/electronic theme will continue, as vibrap=\r\nhonist \nextraordinaire, Peter Jarvis,  propels his mallets into a new work =\r\nby \nArt Krieger, Rainsticks for vibraphone and recording.  Krieger is the \n=\r\nman known for bringing the Jamaican &quot;pan&quot; into the contemporary music \nlite=\r\nrature.  \n\nThe concert will conclude with William Anderson&#39;s Sometimes for =\r\nsolo \nvibraphone, a challenging work written expressly for Jarvis with many=\r\n \nvaried meters and moods.\n\nTickets are $15, $10 students and seniors, TDF =\r\naccepted.

Any scale in this\nformat can be imported from the Import menu command.\nHowever, be sure to first expand the scale to the full midi notes\nrange before importing.\n(Unity has no expand feature to do that.)\nIf the scale is not previously expanded, the remaining notes keep one \nof the two Unity default settings, &quot;Equal Tempered&quot; or &quot;Just\nTempered&quot;.\n\nIt&#39;s also possible to edit each note separately: select a row, click\nthe Edit button (or double-click the selected row) : a dialog appears\nwhere you can type Cents and Hertz.\n\nHTH,\nPhilippe\n\n\n"

Cantilena for George Secor, 17-tET (equal temperament)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigse.mid&gt;\n\n2. Cantilena for George Secor, 17-WT (Secor well-temperament, 1978)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsw.mid&gt;\n\n3. Cantilena for George Secor, 17-ME (my &quot;modified eventone,&quot; 2000)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsm.mid&gt;\n\n4. Cantilena for George Secor, JOT-17 (my 17-note just system, 2002)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid&gt;\n\nAs has often been said, 17-tET and its relatives are unlikely\ncandidates for styles of harmony based on regular thirds at or near\nratios of 5:4 (~386.31 cents) and 6:5 (~315.64 cents); rather, harmony\nin these 17-note systems can draw upon or approximate ratios formed by\nfactors of 2-3-7-9-11-13.\n\nMy composition illustrates one &quot;neo-medieval&quot; style of harmony in 17,\nwith some modern touches: using narrow minor thirds and wide major\nthirds as ingredients in relatively concordant but active sonorities\nwhich resolve to stable sonorities based on fifths and fourths.\n\nTwo characteristic sonorities are a minor third, fifth, and minor\nseventh above the lowest voice, with the seventh tending to contract\nto a fifth; and a major third, fifth, and major sixth, with the third\ntypically expanding to a fifth and the sixth to an octave.\n\nIn one style of microtonal terminology, these sonorities in 17-tone\nand similar systems are often called &quot;subminor seventh chords&quot; and\n&quot;supramajor sixth chords&quot; respectively, to emphasize that the ratios\nare different from the 5-based ones that people often associate with\nmajor and minor thirds and sixths.\n\nWhile basic progressions of this kind are inspired by a 14th-century\nEuropean style, this piece often approaches such progressions by\nsomewhat Renaissance-like suspensions, mixing these elements in a\ntexture which might also suggest the minor seventh and added sixth\nchords of some 20th-century styles.\n\nThese chords and progressions illustrate a characteristic of harmony\nin 17-tone and similar systems. When thirds have ratios at or near 5:4\nand 6:5 -- &quot;5-limit harmony&quot; -- the 5:4 major third placed _below_ the\n6:5 minor third, forming a sonority of 4:5:6, tends to sound more\nsmooth and conclusive than the converse arrangement with the minor\nthird below the major (10:12:15).\n\nIn contrast, with the sizes of regular thirds found in a system like\n17-tET or its relatives, the smaller minor or &quot;subminor&quot; third is most\nsmoothly placed _below_ the larger major or &quot;supramajor&quot; third. A\ncommon example involves the simple ratios of the 6:7 (sub)minor third\nat around 266.87 cents, and the 7:9 (supra)major third at around\n435.08 cents: the 6:7:9 arrangement is often notably smoother than\n14:18:21 with the large major third below. The latter sonority can\nbring lots of tension and excitement, although in higher registers it\ncan take on more smooth qualities.\n\nIt&#39;s also important to say that this &quot;neo-medieval&quot; style is only one\napproach to harmony in 17: another approach, which can also supplement\nthis one, is George Secor&#39;s focus on isoharmonic chords based on\nhigher primes like 7:9:11, 9:11:13, or 7:9:11:13, where adjacent\npartials have the same differences (here two). Indeed, Secor&#39;s 17-WT\nis ingeniously designed to yield nice approximations of these and\nother isoharmonic chords with the right intervals in the right\nplaces to form the desired combinations.\n\nAnother resource of 17 is the wealth of neutral steps and intervals,\nof interest for example in following or borrowing elements from a\nmedieval or later Near Eastern style (where such intervals abound).\n\nMelodically, 17-tone systems feature compact and incisive diatonic\nsemitones, at about 70.588 cents in 17-tET and ranging from around 56\nto 81 cents in the unequal systems here surveyed.\n\nNow let&#39;s quickly consider some of the specifics of these tunings,\nwith links to the MIDI examples provided again for convenience.\n\n1. 17-tone equal temperament (17-tET)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigse.mid&gt;\n\nIn 17-tET, each thirdtone has an identical size of about 70.588 cents,\nand ten of these steps make the fifth at around 705.88 cents, about\n3.93 cents wide. Major thirds at six scale steps are around 423.53\ncents, which seems around the region of maximum complexity, richness,\nor &quot;dissonance,&quot; depending on your point of view (and the timbre).\nWhile this is fine for lots of harmony in a style for 17, and can be\npleasantly exciting, other 17-note systems often seek and obtain major\nthirds at or closer to ratios such as 9:7 or 14:11 (~417.51 cents).\n\n2. George Secor&#39;s 17-tone well-temperament (17-WT)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsw.mid&gt;\n\nThis system, most admirably modelled by analogy to a 12-note\nwell-temperament of the classic late 17th-18th century type, has the\nthirds in the nearer keys or transpositions yield the best\napproximations of 6:7:9, with fifths in this portion of the tuning\ntempered more heavily at about 707.22 cents (about 5.265 cents wide,\ncomparable to meantone in the opposite direction). In the more remote\nportion of the circle, fifths are tempered more mildly at about 704.38\ncents, yielding some just 14:11 major thirds. In this piece, Secor&#39;s\ntemperament brings the (sub)minor seventh sonority C-Eb-G-Bb, for\nexample, not too far from a simple 7-based ratio of 12:14:18:21 (with\nan outer 7:4 minor seventh), about 0-267-702-969 cents in a just\nversion, and 0-278-707-985 cents at this position in 17-WT. The narrow\ndiatonic semitones in the nearer portion of the circle at around 63.90\ncents also have an excellent quality for melody.\n\n3. My 17-tone circulating &quot;modified eventone&quot; (17-ME)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsm.mid&gt;\n\nWhile Secor&#39;s 17-WT shows the kind of grand design that can be applied\nto a 17-tone system, mine might show the flexibility of this genre.\nHaving started with a regular 12-note tuning (Eb-G#) with the fifths\ntempered to produce pure 14:11 major thirds (an arrangement Secor also\nuses, as I was later to learn, in the more remote portion of 17-WT), I\nsimply added five notes to complete a tuning circle, with the most\nheavily tempered fifths and thirds closest to 6:7 and 7:9 in this\nremote portion. For the kind of regular temperament formed by the\nfirst 12 notes, I use the term &quot;eventone&quot; -- a major third, as in a\nmeantone, is formed by two equal or &quot;even&quot; whole-tones. In this\nversion, the fifths are more mildly tempered (about 2.42 cents wide),\nand the thirds rather more complex than in Secor&#39;s 17-WT; diatonic\nsemitones in the nearer portion of the circle, at around 78.115 cents,\nare nicely compact but not so efficient as Secor&#39;s.\n\n4. My &quot;Just Octachord Tuning 17&quot; (JOT-17)\n&lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid&gt;\n\nThis 17-note tuning -- not a &quot;circulating&quot; system under usual timbral\nconditions, since fifths can be wide by as much as 64:63 (~27.26\ncents) -- is largely based on a series of superparticular (n+1:n)\nratios for diatonic semitones or thirdtones -- 28:27, 27:26, 24:23,\n23:22, and 22:21. A fourth is divided into seven thirdtone steps, or\neight notes (e.g. Bb-A#-B-C-Db-C#-D-Eb), and thus my &quot;Just Octachord\nTuning.&quot; While all intervals are based on integer ratios, and 11 of\nthe 17 fifths are pure, one feature resembling a typical 18th-century\nwell-temperament for 12 notes is the appearance of some prominent\nfifths about 5 cents impure (F-C, G-D, A-E). Here, an internal cadence\narrives at one of these &quot;virtually tempered&quot; fifths (A-E), while the\nfinal cadence lands on the pure fifth Bb-F. In the nearer portion of\nthe circle, as in my &quot;modified eventone,&quot; major thirds are at or near\n14:11, with minor thirds at or near 13:11 (~289.21 cents).\n\nTo sum up, the elements in 17 of small minor thirds, large major\nthirds, and compact diatonic semitones can all pull together nicely in\ncongenial styles of harmony and counterpoint. At the same time,\ndifferent 17-tone systems can render the same piece with different\nshades of harmonic color and melodic proportion; as with different\nshades of 16th-century meantone, or 18th-century well-temperament,\nthis variety has its own charm.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

First he played a recent performance of him\ndirecting (and playing recorder)  Bach�s 2nd\nBrandenburg Concerto in Werckmeister III tuning (the\ntwelve unequally-tuned notes create 39 intervals at 6\ncents apart each, making for much more brilliance,\nclarity of individual lines, and an overall sunny\nmusical disposition). My ear can�t measure the exact\ncents accuracy of each note, but the overall effect\nwas one of perfect harmoniousness and intonational\nconsistency. This tuning also allowed for a\nmuch-improved overall ensemble sound and at the same\ntime more individuality of the parts. Pacing,\ninstrumental balance (even of trumpet and recorder!)\nAnd expressiveness In this live recording made this\nthe single best recording of this work I have ever\nheard.\n\nHe also gave me a copy of his Cello Concerto,\nOdysseus, featuring Dave Eggar, a microtonal\norchestra, shofar, piano, singers (for the Sirens), \ntheramin, a towel over the cello, etc.  Odysseus�s\njourney from island to island until he finally lands\nin Ithaca is brilliantly portrayed. Each instrument\nstays in its own tuning system. For example, the four\nclarinets play in quarter-tone, morphed sounds, just\nintonation and blues 7th harmonic tunings\nrespectively. Yet it all comes together as a coherent\nmusical expression.\n\nI host a classical music program in Colorado on\nKGNU-Boulder, 88.5 FM, and I am thrilled to be able to\noffer a world-premiere broadcast of these works (all\nof the Bach and part of the cello concerto) on Sunday\nmorning, May 23, around 9:00 am Mountain Daylight Time\n(11 am East Coast, 8 am West Coast). For people who\nknow Johnny from the microtonal theory chat rooms\netc., here is a chance to really hear what his live\nmusicians can do.  Most of you can hear it at\nwww.kgnu.org (Obviously, the radio station streams its\nsignal over the internet). Hope you can join me for\nabout thirty minutes of alternatively tuned and truly\nbeautiful music!\n\nAll my best,\nChris Mohr\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

If this solves some &quot;reverse engineering&quot; problems for Jon or\nothers, I&#39;d be delighted.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo\nmschulter@...\n\n"

It includes mp3 players\nmidi players and sound recorders\nall for MSDOS.\n\nI use Lame for encoding .wav to mp3s, which is a command\nline tool, but generally use it via a gui someone wrote for it\nrather than use the command line tool directly.\nI use a few command line tools now and again, including\nones I write myself - there generally what I do is to\nmake a batch file with the commands I often use\nand run that batch file from the windows GUi\nand then I edit the batch file within the GUI.\nYou can use batch files in MSDOS too, perhaps you already\nuse them? They save a lot of typing if you have tasks\nthat you do over and over again, the same way each time.\nMy programs also sometimes call command line tools invisibly\nas background tasks.\n\nBut I&#39;ve been programming for a fair while now and in fact first started\nprogramming with mainframe computers with the programs\non punched cards or paper tape. So I have fond recollections\nof the command line environment. Used to program in\nUnix when I was at the maths dept here but by then\nit had all gone over to GUI. Was amazed first time\nI saw a GUI with Windows (Unix style).\n\nThe most useful thing about using a GUI like that for running programs\nis that you can have several &quot;Windows&quot; on your desktop at once, and if\nyou have a long task you want to run in the background\nyou can just run it in one of your windows and\nthen leave it running while you get on with things\nin the other windows - multi-tasking on a single\nmachine! Took a long time for the operating system\nwriters to realise that was a useful thing for\nsomeone to want to do.\n\nThat multi-tasking on a single machine amazed me first\ntime I saw it - and the other thing was the\nway all the windows could respond to the mouse and\nkeyboard at any time, couldn&#39;t imagine how the operating system\ncould sort it all out and cope with all that happening at once\nand asynchronously, seemed mind boggling at first.\nNow I know a little more about how it works but\nappreciate it as most ingenious all the same.\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n"

I.e. the earlier portable\ncomputers. Multi-tasking would have been useful\nthen as now. They had it on mainframes before then\nwhen they were set up with many terminals each connected to the\nsame computer, each user single tasking, but the computer multi-tasking,\nso you would think that if the value of it had been understood,\nit could have been done on personal computers too,\nnot in such a versatile way as in Windows, Macs and\nmodern Linux, maybe in the same way as your\nreference to unix describes it. I know that Windows\nwas late in the game as far as multi-tasking on a\nsingle user machine was concerened.\n\nBut I don&#39;t know much about that part of the history\n- I was out of the loop during the transition\nfrom mainframe to personal computers as my academic\nresearch at the time didn&#39;t need computers at all\nexcept for word processing.\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It includes mp3 players\n&gt; midi players and sound recorders\n&gt; all for MSDOS.\n&gt;\n&gt; I use Lame for encoding .wav to mp3s, which is a command\n&gt; line tool, but generally use it via a gui someone wrote for it\n&gt; rather than use the command line tool directly.\n&gt; I use a few command line tools now and again, including\n&gt; ones I write myself - there generally what I do is to\n&gt; make a batch file with the commands I often use\n&gt; and run that batch file from the windows GUi\n&gt; and then I edit the batch file within the GUI.\n&gt; You can use batch files in MSDOS too, perhaps you already\n&gt; use them? They save a lot of typing if you have tasks\n&gt; that you do over and over again, the same way each time.\n&gt; My programs also sometimes call command line tools invisibly\n&gt; as background tasks.\n&gt;\n&gt; But I&#39;ve been programming for a fair while now and in fact first started\n&gt; programming with mainframe computers with the programs\n&gt; on punched cards or paper tape. So I have fond recollections\n&gt; of the command line environment. Used to program in\n&gt; Unix when I was at the maths dept here but by then\n&gt; it had all gone over to GUI. Was amazed first time\n&gt; I saw a GUI with Windows (Unix style).\n&gt;\n&gt; The most useful thing about using a GUI like that for running programs\n&gt; is that you can have several &quot;Windows&quot; on your desktop at once, and if\n&gt; you have a long task you want to run in the background\n&gt; you can just run it in one of your windows and\n&gt; then leave it running while you get on with things\n&gt; in the other windows - multi-tasking on a single\n&gt; machine! Took a long time for the operating system\n&gt; writers to realise that was a useful thing for\n&gt; someone to want to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; That multi-tasking on a single machine amazed me first\n&gt; time I saw it - and the other thing was the\n&gt; way all the windows could respond to the mouse and\n&gt; keyboard at any time, couldn&#39;t imagine how the operating system\n&gt; could sort it all out and cope with all that happening at once\n&gt; and asynchronously, seemed mind boggling at first.\n&gt; Now I know a little more about how it works but\n&gt; appreciate it as most ingenious all the same.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Robert\n\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

These\nwere played and recorded using a pair of Soundman binaural earpiece\nmicrophones. Then the bowls were given a good &quot;seeing to&quot; using Composer&#39;s\nDesktop Project (CDP) software. CDP was developed by electroacoustic\ncomposer Trevor Wishart over many years with help from IRCAM and UK and\nAmerican researchers. In particular the software allows you to manipulate\nthe spectrum of the sound source and to carry out precise pitch\nmanipulation.

A useful find :-). This scale is\nvery rich in harmonic possibilities isn&#39;t it,\nwhat with the 7/6s as well and the 9/7 and its\nreflection (which you can also pick out in the figure\nfairly easily).\n\nIn fact come to think of it, it is almost like the twelve\nequal diatonic where nearly every\ndiad apart from the tritone and semitone (+ tone??)\nis regarded as consonant - but here as pure ratios\nrather than approximations. Only the tiny semitone step\nisn&#39;t a small number ratio + similarly, the step from one of the notes of each\npair to the other note of the other pair of close pitches.\nThe wide interval there is also pretty acceptable for a consonance\ndepending on the timbre I expect.\n\nI&#39;ll add a link to his diagram to my page. Also I can call it a\nseptimal Dorian, following his example, that will do.\n\n&gt; David Canright has a melodic-harmonic diagram of this scale here:\n\n&gt; http://www.redshift.com/~dcanright/harmel/fig5.gif\n\n&gt; The lines show the 3:2s and 7:4s, while position along the vertical\n&gt; axis shows pitch.\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Also I can call it a\n&gt; septimal Dorian, following his example, that will do.\n\nI know some people would expect septimal Dorian to sound more like it \nwould in Michael Harrison&#39;s music,\n\n(there appear to be some free samples here:\nhttp://www.musical-genre.com/michael_harrison.htm )\n\nmore like\n1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 27/16 7/4 or\n1/1 9/8 7/6 21/16 3/2 27/16 7/4 or\n1/1 8/7 32/27 4/3 32/21 12/7 16/9 or\n1/1 8/7 32/27 4/3 3/2 12/7 16/9\n\nThe 22-equal septimal Dorian (4 1 4 4 4 1 4) approximates all these \nscales, taming the 32:21 wolves they each contain. I find the \ncorresponding aeolian & phrygian modes affecting as well, and \nmodulation can be positively spine-chilling!\n\nAnyway, nice tune!!!!\n\n\n"

Don&#39;t seem to have\nany problems at all playing that far ahead of time as you can hear :-).\nSo I think I agree with whoever it was who said that variation\nin latency is more important than the amount of it, for me anyway.\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The only oddity in the one John says is the 12/11 step.\n\nOne could argue that 10/9 is not xentonal at all, and I would agree. However, \nit is not often used as a tonic to 2nd degree step, but as a 2nd to 3rd \ndegree step, as in (1/1, 9/8, 5/4), where it occurs between 9/8 and 5/4....\n\n\nBest,\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Here I&#39;ll use numbers to\nshow modifications of a Pythagorean pitch (based on a chain or pure\nfifths or fourths) by one or more septimal commas of 64:63 (~27.26\ncents):\n\n   E1      F#2   G0      A1      B1     C#2   D0      E1\n   1/1     8/7   7/6     4/3     3/2    12/7  7/4     2/1\n    0      231   267     498     702    933   969     1200\n\nInterestingly, and very pleasantly, the small 49:48 steps (~35.70\ncents) sound to me like convincing although &quot;different&quot; semitones,\npossibly with the categorical distinctions between large major second\nor sixth and small minor third or seventh reinforcing this effect\nabove a drone.\n\nAs has been commented, the special charm of the 49:48 steps\ndistinguishes this kind of Dorian from another kind which I also love\nand indeed favor in just and tempered systems, for example:\n\n   D1      E1    F0      G1      A1     B1    C0      D1\n   1/1     9/8   7/6     4/3     3/2   27/16  7/4     2/1\n    0      204   267     498     702    906   969     1200\n\nThis has the typical 28:27 semitones or thirdtones (since they&#39;re\nequal to about a third of a 9:8 tone) of Archytas, around 62.96\ncents.\n\nI&#39;d like to compose something using Robert&#39;s scale, possibly with some\nextra tones now and then to facilitate certain progressions, such as\nthis one involving the great 16:21:24:28 sonority: in my keyboard\ntuning discussed above, A1-D0-E1-G0:\n\n          G0     F#1\n          E1     F#1\n          D0     B1\n          A1     B1\n\nThis calls for the note F#1 to form a pure fifth in the resolving\nsonority, in distinction to the &quot;native&quot; F#2 of this scale.\n\nAnother remark: Robert, your scale also led me to note this very nice\nDorian scale in 25-tET, which I might call the most &quot;usual&quot; version of\nDorian, and in my keyboard mapping is played like this:\n\n    C      D   Eb      F     G     A   Bb     C\n    0     240  288    480   720   912  960   1200\n\nSince 25-tET isn&#39;t a regular diatonic tuning (to borrow Easley\nBlackwood&#39;s term) where you can take five identically sized &quot;whole\ntones&quot; and two identically sized &quot;semitones&quot; to make a 2:1 octave,\nI&#39;ll refer to my &quot;usual quasi-diatonic semitone&quot; of 48 cents. This\nstep is somewhere between the 49:48 (~36 cents) of Robert&#39;s scale and\nthe 28:27 (~63 cents) of a more familiar (to me) septimal Dorian.\n\nOne analysis might explain this scale as simply the 5-tET steps plus\nmy customary values for the &quot;usual&quot; minor third and major sixth at 288\ncents and 912 cents. (In 25-tET, what I call &quot;alternatives thirds&quot; are\nalso available at 336 cents and 384 cents, and the 240-cent major\nsecond can also serve as a &quot;quasi-third,&quot; so that one can get lots of\ndifferent nuances).\n\nAgain, Robert, thank you for introducing me to such a charming scale:\nfascinated as I am with the 48-cent semitones of 25-tET, I&#39;m impressed\nby those 36-cent steps which nicely define the difference between a\nseptimal major second or sixth and a minor third or seventh.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

A useful find :-). This scale is\n&gt; &gt; very rich in harmonic possibilities isn&#39;t it,\n&gt; &gt; what with the 7/6s as well and the 9/7 and its\n&gt; &gt; reflection (which you can also pick out in the figure\n&gt; &gt; fairly easily).\n&gt; \n&gt; It, and your description below, reminds me a lot of a &#39;diatonic&#39; \n&gt; scale in 22-equal formed from a chain of (wide) fifths -- \n&gt; particularly in the aeolian mode, but dorian too. This is a highly \n&gt; accessible scale, and can be heard in Randy Winchester&#39;s music in \n22-\n&gt; equal:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://web.mit.edu/randy/www/Music/comets.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Although my excursions in this scale seem to have disappeared from \n&gt; the internet, Margo flattered me on it once :) The scale has three \n&gt; approximate 4:6:7:9 chords, which sound great to me, and in JI this \n&gt; would require extra pitches.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact come to think of it, it is almost like the twelve\n&gt; &gt; equal diatonic where nearly every\n&gt; &gt; diad apart from the tritone and semitone (+ tone??)\n&gt; &gt; is regarded as consonant - but here as pure ratios\n&gt; &gt; rather than approximations. Only the tiny semitone step\n&gt; \n&gt; 49:48\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a small number ratio +\n&gt; &gt; similarly, the step from one of the notes of each\n&gt; &gt; pair to the other note of the other pair of close pitches.\n&gt; \n&gt; 49:32, 49:36, 64:49, 72:49\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The wide interval there is also pretty acceptable for a consonance\n&gt; &gt; depending on the timbre I expect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe, but even the 21:16s and 32:21s in the scale don&#39;t carry \n&gt; that &quot;simple ratio sound&quot;, I find . . . you&#39;d have to fill in a lot \n&gt; of the rest of the harmonic series to get the interval to &quot;sing&quot;, \nin \n&gt; my experience . . . The 22-equal version makes 21;16 and 32;21 the \n&gt; same as 4;3s and 3;2s, and a lot smoother.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll add a link to his diagram to my page. Also I can call it a\n&gt; &gt; septimal Dorian, following his example, that will do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know some people would expect septimal Dorian to sound more like \nit \n&gt; would in Michael Harrison&#39;s music,\n&gt; \n&gt; (there appear to be some free samples here:\n&gt; http://www.musical-genre.com/michael_harrison.htm )\n&gt; \n&gt; more like\n&gt; 1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 27/16 7/4 or\n&gt; 1/1 9/8 7/6 21/16 3/2 27/16 7/4 or\n&gt; 1/1 8/7 32/27 4/3 32/21 12/7 16/9 or\n&gt; 1/1 8/7 32/27 4/3 3/2 12/7 16/9\n&gt; \n&gt; The 22-equal septimal Dorian (4 1 4 4 4 1 4) approximates all these \n&gt; scales, taming the 32:21 wolves they each contain. I find the \n&gt; corresponding aeolian & phrygian modes affecting as well, and \n&gt; modulation can be positively spine-chilling!\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, nice tune!!!!\n\n\n"

IIRC, after pages of tables of permuted\ntetrachords, \nS said that only those approximated by the 17-tone cycle of fifths scale\nwere in use in\nhis day.\n\nIn general, the Greeks put the smallest intervals at the bottom of the\ntetrachord and the\nlargest on top, though there are are exceptions  such as Archytas&#39;s\n28/27 x 8/7 x 9/8, 28/27 x 36/35 x 5/4, and Didymos&#39;s 16/15 x 25/24 x\n6/5. In these cases, the choice of the first interval\nmay have depended upon the interval it made with a note a 9/8 below the\nfirst note of the tetrachord (mese for the diezeugmenon tetrachord,\nproslambanomenos for hypaton, and an extra note, diatonic lichanos\nhypaton or hyperhypate, for the meson). The use of this composite\ninterval appears to have been a standard stylistic feature of music in\nthe enharmonic and chromatic genera.\n\nThere is good reason to believe that the so-called &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning\nof the diatonic\ngenus was the oldest scale in Greek art music (see Franklin&#39;s\ndissertation) and that the enharmonic derived from 5-toned folk scales\nof the semitone-Major third (ditone) type. \nThis scale is derivable from the diatonic by gapping, of course. The\nchromatic genus developed\nfrom the enharmonic, which became heptatonic only around the end of the\n4th century BCE and\nthe beginning of the 3rd. Stopping half-way between the enharmonic and\nchromatic produces\nAristoxenos&#39;s hemiolic chromatic (75 + 75 + 350 cents), giving another\nexample of the neutral third.\n\nI suggest that the neutral diatonic type of scale such as Ptolemy&#39;s\nEquable or Even Diatonic, Al-Farabi&#39;s reduplicated 3/4-tone genera, etc.\nare not Greek, but possibly of African or Arabian origin. I think\nPtolemy heard them in Alexandria, which was the most cosmopolitan city\nin the eastern Mediterranean area in the 2nd century CE. In addition to\nlarge Greek and  Egyptian population, there were Romans, Jews, Arabs,\nEthiopians, Persians, etc., and even Buddhist missionaries from India\nliving and trading there. \n\n--John\n\n"

A fourth is divided into seven \n&gt; thirdtone steps, or eight notes (e.g. Bb-A#-B-C-Db-C#-D-Eb), and \n&gt; thus my &quot;Just Octachord Tuning.&quot; While all intervals are based on \n&gt; integer ratios, and 11 of the 17 fifths are pure, one feature \n&gt; resembling a typical 18th-century well-temperament for 12 notes \n&gt; is the appearance of some prominent fifths about 5 cents impure \n&gt; (F-C, G-D, A-E). Here, an internal cadence arrives at one of \n&gt; these &quot;virtually tempered&quot; fifths (A-E), while the final cadence \n&gt; lands on the pure fifth Bb-F. In the nearer portion of\n&gt; the circle, as in my &quot;modified eventone,&quot; major thirds are at or \n&gt; near 14:11, with minor thirds at or near 13:11 (~289.21 cents).\n&gt; \n\n\n"

New Albion Records (2002),  \nSan Francisco, no catalog number listed. 26 tracks, 75 minutes.\n\nBurman-Hall performs on single & double harpsichords, tack piano, and  \nfortepiano. The liner notes are extensive (and in small print).\n\nThis is a pleasant CD that includes a variety of mood pieces and a set of  \n&quot;sonatas&quot; for cembalo in historic tunings. (That&#39;s &quot;sonata&quot; in the early  \nScarlatti sort of sense as short one-movement pieces.) Many of the pieces  \nare rather &quot;nostalgic&quot;, I guess you&#39;d say, for an earlier, gentler age.  \nThis is a nice introduction to microtonality to spring on your friends  \nwho&#39;ve never heard of &quot;tuning&quot;.\n\nTunings on the CD include Werkmeister III, Kirnberger II, and several of  \nLou Harrison&#39;s own &quot;well temperaments&quot;, and one 7-limit JI tuning.\n\nExcept for the very first piece on the album, which for some reason turned  \nme off, I enjoyed the whole thing. Definitely worth a spin for anyone who  \nlikes the harpsichord, early music, or well-temperaments.\n\n\tRick\n\n"

I agree that the\nsemitones are convincing small steps especially\nwhen the harmonic context makes them distinctive\nin their role. I have a fondness for small\nsemitones too.\n\nI had the pleasure of finding this scale for myself\nas a new one (to me), though of course it is now\nabout a thousand years old at least, with Al Farabi in\nthe tenth century AD as the original discover\n(unless someone else preceded him).\nI wonder how many people have come across it\nin various ways and it explored it in all those\ncenturies.\n\nI&#39;ve also been wondering about how you might\nextend it to a scale of e.g. 12 notes since\nthat is convenient on a conventional keyboard\nsingle manual.\n\nBTW I have tried out your double manual style\nof playing from time to time. What I found is\nthat the keyboards I tried are rather deep, so you\ncan&#39;t stretch a single hand from one of the\nmanuals to the other. But I know there are\nkeyboards that are less deep than these.\n\nDo you play them two handed with one hand for each manual\n(in that case apart from the extra range you get\nwith two keyboards, and the shorter distance to\nmove the hands, one could also play on a keyboard divided\nleft and right with a comma difference in tuning\nor whatever one wants between the two halves\n- as I did in my improvisation in your\nsesquisexta scale).\n\nOr do you have keyboards shallow enough so that\nyou can play on two at once with a single\nhand? Come to think of it, one only needs\none shallow keyboard, for the one that\nsits on top.\n\nBTW I have added a new option to FTS\nto make any formula you like into\na wave to use e.g. for example\nchords in harmonic timbres\n- but also they can be made into\nsound fonts e.g. for the SB Live! or\nfor Giga. After I have finished the\nupload I&#39;ll try making a few fonts\nfor both of those, and make\nthem available. (FTS can&#39;t play the\nwaves directly at present, so has to make them\ninto wave files then play those,\nor sound fonts for a wavetable midi synth).\n\nIt includes Bessel functions\nwhich make an interesting rounded sawtooth\nand I tried x*sin(1/x) and variants\nsuch as x^3*sin(1/x^3) which have\ninfinitely many waves getting smaller\nand smaller as you approach the origin.\n\nIt also lets you build the functions up into\na harmonic series and you can quantise the\nseries to the current scale so I can experiment\nwith Setherising, I was surprised to find that\nsine waves didn&#39;t work so well there\nas more complex functions - you got beats\nwithin a single note if you use\nsine waves for e.g. equal tempered partials\nin a harmonic series but when you replaced\nthem with more complex curves then the beats\nwent away. So there is clearly a bit of an art\nto this. But if I can make a nice Setherised\ntimbre or two that could be fun to explore.\n\n(any FTS users - this isn&#39;t ready yet but\nthe new upload is probably later today\nwith some luck, first upload for a number of months\nnow).\n\nThanks,\n\nRobet\n\n\n\n"

So there is clearly a bit of an art\n&gt; to this.\n\nHi Robert,\n\nThis is one of the most fascinating posts I&#39;ve seen in a long time.\n\nWould you mind getting a bit deeper on all this on one of the more \nanalytical lists, such as harmonic_entropy, tuning, or tuning-math?\n\nI&#39;d enjoy that, anyway.\n\nBest,\nPaul\n\n\n"

So there is clearly a bit of an art\n&gt; &gt; to this.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is one of the most fascinating posts I&#39;ve seen in a long time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you mind getting a bit deeper on all this on one of the more\n&gt; analytical lists, such as harmonic_entropy, tuning, or tuning-math?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d enjoy that, anyway.\n\nThe curves are maybe best explained\nwith screen shots of them - I&#39;ll\ndo some to follow this up.\n\nThe basic mathematical idea I used\nis to let the user enter any mathematical formula\nto set a curve for either the\nquarter, half or complete wave.\n\nIf it is intended for a quarter wave, FTS adds a constant\nterm to ensure that it starts at 0.\nThen it does the other three quarters\nso that they all join up seamlessly\n- continuous lines anyway though they\nmay not be smooth where the various\nquarters meet.\n\nIf it is intended for a half curve, then it\ndoes two rotated copies, so again\nthey meet up and indeed this time\nthey will meet up smoothly too if the\noriginal curve is smooth at origin.\nThis time it adds a linear term to\nensure that the start and end points of the\ncurve are both 0.\n\nIf it is a complete wave, then FTS\nwill add a quadratic term to ensure\nthat the two endpoints of the curve\nare both zero, and that in between\nit has as much of the curve above\nas below the zero line (so that\nthe areas above and below are equal).\nThis won&#39;t necessarily always be a smooth\ncurve where they endpoints meet up\nfrom one wave to the next however.\n\nIt then normalises the result so that\nwhatever your formula, the maximum\nheight of the wave remains the same.\n\nSo you can use any formula for any\nof those, e.g. you could use say, x^3\nfor all three and it would still\nwork and make continuous\nrepeating sound waves you can play\nand listen to.\n\nYou also have a choice of a few\npresets too - sine waves,\ntriangles, a sine triangle, and\nrepeated sines which make a kind\nof a rounded square wave,\nand you can morph any of your\ncurves with a sine wave to\nmake a curve that is between\nthe two (e.g. 80 % your curve\nand 20 % sine or whatever).\n\nThen it adds together any desred number\nof these waves to make\na harmonic series. The series\ncan be quantised to the current\nscale e.g.to 7-et or 12-et or whatever.\n\nThen the Setherised thing is a matter\npartly of personal preference I think\n- maybe the Setherised sine curve harmonic timbres\nare in a sense smoother but they also have more obvious beats\n(i.e. for each single note on its own)\nwhile more complex curves end up with\na kind of uniform texture or roughness\nso that you don&#39;t hear the beats within\nthat texture so clearly, so it\nmay sound more harmonious in some sense\nif not really smoother.\n\nThe x^n*sin(1/x^n)  etc family of curves\nwhich I tried out is quite interesting here - when you set\nn high you get something more like a series\nof fast clicks, so a buzz, rather than a\nwave, and the more it is like that then\nthe less you notice any beats, but the\nnote gets very kind of rough (an interesting\ntexture and still with a distinctive\npitch in it but a bit more towards a kind of\ncoloured noise rather than a note).\n\nAnyway when I have some time after the upload\nI&#39;ll do a web page about it with graphics\nand sound clips, and some sound fonts\nand Gigs to download for users of the\nSB soundcards or others that can use\nSF2 fonts, and for users of GigaSampler\n/ GigaStudio. They consist of just\nsingle waves so are tiny and the new\n\nFTS has an option to make wave clips\nfor all the octaves for a sound font in one go.\n\nHowever for best pitch accuracy you want\nthe high pitch waves to be an integral\nnumber of samples. At present it\nuses 1/100 of the sample rate\nfor the 1/1 of the sound font samples as it were,\nand then goes up and down in octaves\nfrom that point. So that pitches\nthem at A = 441, then if you want\nA = 440 you can adjust the\nresult down by 4 cents when you use\nthe sound font.\n\nIf you try A = 440 at 44.1 Khz\nthat doesn&#39;t work well. It is important\nto get the numbers right there as\nthe higher notes have very few samples,\ne.g.at A = 441, then a uses\n100 samples for a single wave, a&#39; uses 50, and a&#39;&#39; uses\nonly 25. Clearly something like\n49.5 approximated by 50 there would throw\nthe pitch well out. Best solution would\nbe if you could use the lowest pitch wave\nfor everything but in the SF2 fonts\nanyway it seems it won&#39;t let you raise the\npitch more than about an octave or two.\n(will be interested to know if anyone\nhas any tips about this).\n\nThe other solution is to record\na train of e.g. 100 waves\ninstead of a single wave,\nwhich is an alternative - though the single\nwave is more elegant.\n\nAnother idea is to set A=440 and\nthen save the sound clips at\n44 Khz which you can do in FTS\nand I think the SF2 format anyway\ncan handle data in that format,\nand play it at the appropriate pitch, will see.\n\nMore later when I do the web page,\nand will be interested to know if\nanyone has any tips on the sound fonts.\nAlso has anyone come across any other program\nthat lets you play any mathematical equation\nyou like to enter as a sound wave?\n\nIf anyone has any particular questions\nbe sure to ask too,\n\nBest,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Am I understanding you\n&gt; correctly?\n\nYes, I think so. Made by stacking e.g. sine curves, or also\nother curves such as rounded saw tooth etc into a harmonic\nseries of pitches with the pitches quantised to whatever\nscale you want e.g. 12-et or 17-et or whatever.\n\n&gt; Yes. Inharmonic timbres will generally have combinational tones which\n&gt; beat against the partials and against one another, and according to\n&gt; John Chalmers, even virtual pitches can beat against combinational\n&gt; tones. I replied to your message on the tuning list, and I&#39;m hoping I\n&gt; got your meaning right above, since that&#39;s what I assumed in my\n&gt; tuning list reply.\n\nAh right that may be what it is, beating of combinational tones\nwith each other or the partials. I wondered how it happened.\nI was using a harmonic series of quite a few terms, e.g.\n5 terms or 13. I wonder if missing out some of the partials\nmay be a way to reduce those beats then. Well tht will\nprobably be for another upload after this - I plan to\nadd options to let the user set the volumes individually\nfor each partial (and the pitches too if they like).\nRight now it just does them with the volumes\ndecreasing as you go up the series.\n\nMeanwhile what I can do is to add radios to do\nonly the odd harmonics or only odd prime\nharmonics - to reduce the number of partials\nso of combination tones - maybe that will help make\nthe Setherised chords smoother.\n\nJust as a taster, here is a screen shot:\n\nhttp://www.robertinventor.com/xpn_sin_1oxpn.gif\n\nShows x^n sin(1/x^n) though can&#39;t remember what n was\n- it&#39;s just a screen shot I made for debugging.\n\nNormally all the ripples would be about the zero line,\nbut it is curved like this because of the quadratic term\nthat gets added to make the areas above and below\nthe zero line the same size, as they are in normal\nsound waves.\n\nAs you vary the parameters in another window,\n(including the n) then the curve\nchanges instantly in the oscilloscope and you can click\nthe Play this button to hear it.\n\nI&#39;ve cc&#39;d this to tuning, and posted another reply\nto your post there.\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But you have to be careful re-tuning acoustic instruments.  \nThey&#39;re made to sound best in a particular range, and also you won&#39;t want  \ntoo much changing of the strings from their normal tension.

IIRC, after pages of tables of permuted\n &gt; tetrachords,\n &gt; S said that only those approximated by the 17-tone cycle of fifths scale\n &gt; were in use in\n &gt; his day.\n\n &gt; In general, the Greeks put the smallest intervals at the bottom of the\n &gt; tetrachord and the\n &gt; largest on top, though there are are exceptions  such as Archytas&#39;s\n &gt; 28/27 x 8/7 x 9/8, 28/27 x 36/35 x 5/4, and Didymos&#39;s 16/15 x 25/24 x\n &gt; 6/5. In these cases, the choice of the first interval\n &gt; may have depended upon the interval it made with a note a 9/8 below the\n &gt; first note of the tetrachord (mese for the diezeugmenon tetrachord,\n &gt; proslambanomenos for hypaton, and an extra note, diatonic lichanos\n &gt; hypaton or hyperhypate, for the meson). The use of this composite\n &gt; interval appears to have been a standard stylistic feature of music in\n &gt; the enharmonic and chromatic genera.\n\n &gt; There is good reason to believe that the so-called &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning\n &gt; of the diatonic\n &gt; genus was the oldest scale in Greek art music (see Franklin&#39;s\n &gt; dissertation) and that the enharmonic derived from 5-toned folk scales\n &gt; of the semitone-Major third (ditone) type.\n &gt; This scale is derivable from the diatonic by gapping, of course. The\n &gt; chromatic genus developed\n &gt; from the enharmonic, which became heptatonic only around the end of the\n &gt; 4th century BCE and\n &gt; the beginning of the 3rd. Stopping half-way between the enharmonic and\n &gt; chromatic produces\n &gt; Aristoxenos&#39;s hemiolic chromatic (75 + 75 + 350 cents), giving another\n &gt; example of the neutral third.\n\n &gt; I suggest that the neutral diatonic type of scale such as Ptolemy&#39;s\n &gt; Equable or Even Diatonic, Al-Farabi&#39;s reduplicated 3/4-tone genera, etc.\n &gt; are not Greek, but possibly of African or Arabian origin. I think\n &gt; Ptolemy heard them in Alexandria, which was the most cosmopolitan city\n &gt; in the eastern Mediterranean area in the 2nd century CE. In addition to\n &gt; large Greek and  Egyptian population, there were Romans, Jews, Arabs,\n &gt; Ethiopians, Persians, etc., and even Buddhist missionaries from India\n &gt; living and trading there.\n\n &gt; --John\n\n\n"

HP used fingernail polish\nwhich you can also feel under you fingers. When i replaced my hammer\ndulcimer bridges with brass ,i also found it useful to mark a series of\nfourths for visual reference. The down side is toxic and so one should use\nit outside.\n\n    I imagine The Bassist Jack Bruce would have liked such an instrument\nstarting on cello and going to 6 string bass\n\nMark Gould wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Follow Partch and mark the fingerboard or if you can knock some brads\n&gt; in at suitable locatons. I like the brads as you can feel them under\n&gt; your hands, and when it comes to intonation, cause thay&#39;re not frets\n&gt; you can still be flexible.\n\n-- -Kraig Grady\nNorth American Embassy of Anaphoria Island\n http://www.anaphoria.com\nThe Wandering Medicine Show\n KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST\n\n\n"

I tune my acoustic guitar in fifths, like a cello. \nCGDAEG (minor third on top).  The easiest way to to this is to get the correct gauge of string for\neach note.  This is important whether you want to tune your guitar like a cello, or your cello\nlike a guitar.  Then string tension is maintained and tonal quality remains high.  Not to mention\nthe instrument is not damaged from overtightening some of the strings.\n\n     Finding specialty gauges can be daunting, though in this day and age of the Internet almost\nanything can be found.\n\n     Stephen\n\n\n&gt; I posted about &#39;cellos and viols but my post appears to be missing. I \n&gt; won&#39;t repeat myself, but I made two suggestions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Viols have 6 strings, the bass is tuned D G C E A D, tenor GCFADG \n&gt; and treble DGCEAD\n&gt; 2. obtain a childs 14/ or 1/8 cello and tune it with \n&gt; guitar/zither/viola strings to B2E3A3D3 mid c = C4\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.

I don&#39;t know who on a bad day one would say it sounds\n&gt; like, but certainly not Beethoven.\n\nThe language harmonically speaking is neo-French due the the prevalence of \nparallellism and 9th type chords. This was an attractive feature of it for \nme!!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, but I have some compositional notes:\n\nfor me, the opening texture is very promising and interesting, but for 8+ \nminutes, it gets a bit much (for me anyway it did). I would prefer to hear it \nstop, have two or three contrasting ideas to mix into the form, etc. There \nwas a lot of subtle stuff going on, but it was a little to &#39;caffeinated&#39; and \nrelentlessly modulatory--like a French Reger on steroids and crack--let your \nlisteners revel in your well thought out and interesting part writing by \nputting in some rests, pauses, contrast ! It had neither the slow evolution \nof minimalism nor the logical argument of a high classical structure such as \nfugue sonata, or some yet-to-be named neo-Sibelian organic form. Instead the \nopening idea was obsessed on for 8+ minutes, with rapid modulations, etc. \nMaybe, if you like the surface to be this busy, at least give us a slower \nharmonic motion !!! It was hard to digest the microactivity without a break, \nor a larger argument with contrast as would occur in a \nsubject/counter-subject type composition.\n\nFor me, the restlessness started to sound like white noise after 2 minutes, \nand it lost me. Moment to moment, I realized that what was happening was \ndelicious, tuning-wise, etc, so I stayed it out to the end, but I wanted to \nhave a developmental reason to do so as well !!!\n\nAll the instruments were pretty much playing all the time, and this added to \nthe monotony for me: at 5&#39;24&quot; there was a nice break were you kept the reeds \ngoing, but it was broken again within 3 seconds, so I was frustrated at how \nbrief that *delightful* repose was !!! If you look at the orchestration of \n*any* masterwork, there are plenty of contrasting colors and densities.\n\nI think you have it in you to make a tremendous work of this. The ideas are \nbold and pregnant, and the sound of the tuning, mixing/panning and the \ninstruments are promising. Of course, it&#39;s still MIDI, with all it&#39;s \nlimitations, etc. But I was keenly aware of being brought to a wildly \ninterested attention by the opening, a sure sign of a great musical idea.\n\nIf you would humor me: try starting it, and sustaining the chord that occurs \nat 0&#39;04&quot;, followed by a fermata of silence. Then continue, but bring it back \nin a developmental way as you have done, but punctuate it with occasional \nsilences. Introduce a counter-subject that is subtlely related in some way to \nthe original (inversion, Schenkerian similarity, elision, rhythmic mutation, \nthe techniques for doing this are many.....) Drop out some players. Plan this \nactivity to go on in such a way so as to articulate a hand-wringing climax \nsomewhere close to .618 of the length in ;) (for a clich� example). To me, if \nyou did that, it would be an orgasmically amazing microtonal masterwork !!\n\nIn short, what you do on the surface is delightful, now what is needed is a \nlarge-scale direction/momentum/argument/architecture/thesis-antithesis.\nOr, a better way of not obscuring what form I can glean is there (I did \nrecognize ceertain motives, which were not clearly *articulated* by any other \nparameters such as phrasing, silence, orchestration, etc....\n\nOf course, all these notes are just my opinion, so take it or leave it :) \nComposition is a very personal thing.....all we can say is what works for \neach of us as a listener, and its not always going to be the same from person \nto person.\n\nThanks for sharing it !!! You&#39;ve proven that 99-equal is very cool ;)\n\nBest,\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n\n"

Johnson&quot; \n&lt;akjmicro@c...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Overall, I enjoyed it, but I have some compositional notes:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nfor me, the opening texture is very promising and interesting, but \nfor 8+ =\r\n\n&gt; minutes, it gets a bit much (for me anyway it did). I would prefer \nto h=\r\near it \n&gt; stop, have two or three contrasting ideas to mix into the form, \n=\r\netc. There \n&gt; was a lot of subtle stuff going on, but it was a little \nto &#39;=\r\ncaffeinated&#39; and \n&gt; relentlessly modulatory--like a French Reger on steroid=\r\ns and crack--\nlet your \n&gt; listeners revel in your well thought out and inte=\r\nresting part \nwriting by \n&gt; putting in some rests, pauses, contrast ! \n\nTha=\r\nnks, Aaron. I was thinking of it as sort of Renaissance crossed \nwith class=\r\nical; the idea being to sort of flow along and obsess in \nsomething like th=\r\ne manner of Renaissance a capella music. Maybe I \nwent too far with this id=\r\nea. :)\n\nIt had neither the slow evolution \n&gt; of minimalism nor the logical =\r\nargument of a high classical \nstructure such as \n&gt; fugue sonata, or some ye=\r\nt-to-be named neo-Sibelian organic form. \n\nI keep thinking I should try a f=\r\nugue, but the idea is a little \nterrifying.\n\nInstead the \n&gt; opening idea wa=\r\ns obsessed on for 8+ minutes, with rapid \nmodulations, etc. \n&gt; Maybe, if yo=\r\nu like the surface to be this busy, at least give us a \nslower \n&gt; harmonic =\r\nmotion !!!\n\nThink of all the chords there are when you have 99 notes to an =\r\n\noctave. :)\n\n It was hard to digest the microactivity without a break, \n&gt; o=\r\nr a larger argument with contrast as would occur in a \n&gt; subject/counter-su=\r\nbject type composition.\n&gt; \n&gt; For me, the restlessness started to sound like=\r\n white noise after 2 \nminutes, \n&gt; and it lost me.\n\nAh well. At least it&#39;s d=\r\nifferent. I find that when music is complex, \nit&#39;s often good for repeated =\r\nlistening.\n\n Moment to moment, I realized that what was happening was \n&gt; de=\r\nlicious, tuning-wise, etc, so I stayed it out to the end, but I \nwanted to =\r\n\n&gt; have a developmental reason to do so as well !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; All the instrument=\r\ns were pretty much playing all the time, and this \nadded to \n&gt; the monotony=\r\n for me: at 5&#39;24&quot; there was a nice break were you kept \nthe reeds \n&gt; going,=\r\n but it was broken again within 3 seconds, so I was \nfrustrated at how \n&gt; b=\r\nrief that *delightful* repose was !!! If you look at the \norchestration of =\r\n\n&gt; *any* masterwork, there are plenty of contrasting colors and \ndensities.=\r\n\n\nThe contrasts in Renaissance polyphony are often very subtle; \ncompared t=\r\no Palestrina this was a blow to the head with a blunt \nobject. Of course Pa=\r\nlestrina would probably have run out the door if \nhe&#39;s heard this thing.\n\n&gt;=\r\n I think you have it in you to make a tremendous work of this. The \nideas a=\r\nre \n&gt; bold and pregnant, and the sound of the tuning, mixing/panning and \nt=\r\nhe \n&gt; instruments are promising. Of course, it&#39;s still MIDI, with all \nit&#39;s=\r\n \n&gt; limitations, etc. But I was keenly aware of being brought to a \nwildly =\r\n\n&gt; interested attention by the opening, a sure sign of a great musical \nide=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you would humor me: try starting it, and sustaining the chord \nt=\r\nhat occurs \n&gt; at 0&#39;04&quot;, followed by a fermata of silence. Then continue, bu=\r\nt \nbring it back \n&gt; in a developmental way as you have done, but punctuate =\r\nit with \noccasional \n&gt; silences. Introduce a counter-subject that is subtle=\r\nly related in \nsome way to \n&gt; the original (inversion, Schenkerian similari=\r\nty, elision, rhythmic \nmutation, \n&gt; the techniques for doing this are many.=\r\n....) Drop out some players. \nPlan this \n&gt; activity to go on in such a way =\r\nso as to articulate a hand-wringing \nclimax \n&gt; somewhere close to .618 of t=\r\nhe length in ;) (for a clich=E9 example). \nTo me, if \n&gt; you did that, it wo=\r\nuld be an orgasmically amazing microtonal \nmasterwork !!\n\nThanks again, Aar=\r\non. My response to that is that I&#39;d rather try for \nsomething along those l=\r\nines in a new piece, and let this one stay as \nthe continuous musical flow =\r\nI had in mind. Of course, I also had it \nin mind to make it a Csound piece,=\r\n and it didn&#39;t stay as that. \n\n&gt; In short, what you do on the surface is de=\r\nlightful, now what is \nneeded is a \n&gt; large-scale direction/momentum/argume=\r\nnt/architecture/thesis-\nantithesis.\n&gt; Or, a better way of not obscuring wha=\r\nt form I can glean is there (I \ndid \n&gt; recognize ceertain motives, which we=\r\nre not clearly *articulated* by \nany other \n&gt; parameters such as phrasing, =\r\nsilence, orchestration, etc....\n\nOh, you can bet there were motives!\n\n&gt; Tha=\r\nnks for sharing it !!! You&#39;ve proven that 99-equal is very \ncool ;)\n \nIsn&#39;t=\r\n it just? You don&#39;t need to go crazy and move around \nharmonically unless y=\r\nou want to, either; there are some nice MOS one \ncould try, for instance.\n\n=\r\n\n"

Not an \neasy task to speak about another&#39;s music in such a detailed and objective \n(yet personal) manner. Glad you are here to do just that. I&#39;ll add just a \ncouple of thoughts for Gene as well, as I dl&#39;d it and gave it two listens \n(one somewhat in the background).\n\n{you wrote...}\n&gt;for me, the opening texture is very promising and interesting, but for 8+\n&gt;minutes, it gets a bit much (for me anyway it did). [snip] For me, the \n&gt;restlessness started to sound like white noise after 2 minutes, and it lost me.\n\nVery much agreed. I decided I wouldn&#39;t remark on this feature any more (as \nI have in the past) after Gene explained his compositional process. But \nGene, I hope you take a portion of Aaron&#39;s thoughts to heart, because I \nsecond the notion that you will find few audience members willing to listen \nto extended stretches of this manner of composition with nary a break in \ntexture, motion, density, etc. It doesn&#39;t come off minimal enough for me to \ngo into &quot;Reich-mode&quot; and settle in for long-term development. One would \nhope that, if we consider that there are a lot of things going on, you \ncould find a way to isolate some of them and dwell in those areas a little \nmore.\n\nIt is a strong signal that when a fine musician like Aaron has difficulty \navoiding tuning out in a short span, it may mean something.\n\nI like the sound of this piece, however - there is a more organic nature to \nall of it, not really mimicing other instruments nor settling firmly in a \ncompletely electronic world. The constant &#39;tutti&#39; nature of the scoring \nreminds me a lot of Frank Zappa&#39;s work with (first) the Synclavier, and \nlater his orchestrations of some of those works. While they aren&#39;t \nmicrotonal, you might find it illuminating to contrast an electronic \nrendition of his with a later-orchestrated one (&quot;The Girl in the Magnesium \nDress&quot; would be one good example).\n\n&gt;All the instruments were pretty much playing all the time, and this added \n&gt;to the monotony for me: at 5&#39;24&quot; there was a nice break were you kept the \n&gt;reeds going, but it was broken again within 3 seconds, so I was frustrated \n&gt;at how brief that *delightful* repose was !!! If you look at the \n&gt;orchestration of *any* masterwork, there are plenty of contrasting colors \n&gt;and densities.\n\nAgain, parallel to some of my comments to you in the past, but maybe \nunavoidable in your current manner of working. Maybe, just maybe, one or \nmore of these works will highlight an area of a composition that pushes you \ninto working in a slightly different compositional framework (i.e. working \non individual lines, rather than letting Maple fill in the blanks), and \nallow you to craft more musical nuances into the already interesting \nintonational canvas.\n\n&gt;In short, what you do on the surface is delightful, now what is needed is \n&gt;a large-scale direction/momentum/argument/architecture/thesis-antithesis. \n&gt;Or, a better way of not obscuring what form I can glean is there (I did \n&gt;recognize ceertain motives, which were not clearly *articulated* by any \n&gt;other parameters such as phrasing, silence, orchestration, etc....\n\nAs you noted in your reply, there are motives; as Aaron notes, they are not \neasily discernable, something that can be remedied with further attention \nto the parameters mentioned above.\n\nAs always, illuminating to see how each of us approaches making this music \nin very different (and valid!) ways...\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

I decided I wouldn&#39;t remark on this feature any \nmore (as \n&gt; I have in the past) after Gene explained his compositional process. \nBut \n&gt; Gene, I hope you take a portion of Aaron&#39;s thoughts to heart, \nbecause I \n&gt; second the notion that you will find few audience members willing \nto listen \n&gt; to extended stretches of this manner of composition with nary a \nbreak in \n&gt; texture, motion, density, etc.\n\nThat&#39;s not really a requirement of the compositional process. Did you \nhave the same reaction to 45000 Fingers, which did a lot of the \nthings Aaron wanted to see done here?\n\n It doesn&#39;t come off minimal enough for me to \n&gt; go into &quot;Reich-mode&quot; and settle in for long-term development. One \nwould \n&gt; hope that, if we consider that there are a lot of things going on, \nyou \n&gt; could find a way to isolate some of them and dwell in those areas a \nlittle \n&gt; more.\n\nIt&#39;s not minimal at all, really; it&#39;s more like some 20th century \nmaximalist pieces where a lot of stuff keeps happening so it has \nsomething of the same effect. To me, I can just zone out on this kind \nof thing, it massages my brain; but I rather suspected most people \nwouldn&#39;t much like it. I haven&#39;t had any complaints about the \noccasional outbursts of treble hysteria, though, which I *was* \nexpecting.\n\n&gt; Again, parallel to some of my comments to you in the past, but \nmaybe \n&gt; unavoidable in your current manner of working. \n\nNot at all. Compare it with 45000 Fingers or (if I ever fix it) \nBodacious Breed.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, one or \n&gt; more of these works will highlight an area of a composition that \npushes you \n&gt; into working in a slightly different compositional framework (i.e. \nworking \n&gt; on individual lines, rather than letting Maple fill in the blanks), \nand \n&gt; allow you to craft more musical nuances into the already \ninteresting \n&gt; intonational canvas.\n\nMaple adjusted the intonation for me; filling in the blanks was my \nchoice. Maple, in other words, helped me turn the lines into 99-equal \nlines, the chords into 99-equal chords, and change totally static \nharmony into restless motion.\n\n&gt; As you noted in your reply, there are motives; as Aaron notes, they \nare not \n&gt; easily discernable, something that can be remedied with further \nattention \n&gt; to the parameters mentioned above.\n\nI still feel it makes more sense to move on than try to make this \ninto a completely different piece.\n\n\n\n\n"

After as long a pause on\nthe previous note as one likes.\n\nI suppose the feeling is that you can stop anywhere\nfor as long as you like, but however long\nyou stop, you could continue again at any\nmoment and go on to the next note - so a\nmelody in this harmonic fragment never\nreally finishes :-).\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Actually, I thought it possible most people would find \nit irritating; I wrote it as I sometimes do to please myself. Does \nyour girlfriend have reactions to other microtonal music you think \nyou can share?\n\nIt strikes me that if we overlook our objection to this or that \npiece, or even this or that microtonal composer, and look at the big \npicture, we are in a kind of microtonal Renaissance now. Step back \nand look at the rate at which new microtonal music is being created \nwith the perspective of time. Maybe we are all a microtonal Mannheim \nschool, sending up our rockets and awating a microtonal Mozart. We \nmay think we don&#39;t have much of an audience, but how big an audience \ndid people have back then?\n\n\n"

Actually, I thought it possible most people would find \n&gt; it irritating; I wrote it as I sometimes do to please myself. Does \n&gt; your girlfriend have reactions to other microtonal music you think \n&gt; you can share?\n\nWell, she&#39;s usually pretty indifferent but I think that&#39;s because the \nmusical style of microtonal pieces is most often classical/art music \nwhile she is pop-oriented in her listening habits. \n \n&gt; It strikes me that if we overlook our objection to this or that \n&gt; piece, or even this or that microtonal composer, and look at the \nbig \n&gt; picture, we are in a kind of microtonal Renaissance now. Step back \n&gt; and look at the rate at which new microtonal music is being created \n&gt; with the perspective of time. Maybe we are all a microtonal \nMannheim \n&gt; school, sending up our rockets and awating a microtonal Mozart. We \n&gt; may think we don&#39;t have much of an audience, but how big an \naudience \n&gt; did people have back then?\n\nMusicians are becoming more aware of the possibilities and are \nexperimenting. But I believe that tuning is not as interesting to the \nlistening public as stylistic considerations and surface sound of the \nmusic. If some hip hop artist deliberately uses microtonal \ninflections in his/her song I believe almost nobody notices anything \nunusual. I believe microtonality is not a style but at the same time \nI believe that different tunings have different stylistic \nimplications. \n\nKalle\n \n\n\n"

In June, 2004, two concerts featuring major,\nlarge-scale works of So=\r\nrabji will take place at Merkin Concert Hall in\nManhattan.\n\nOn June 20th at=\r\n 4pm, Jonathan Powell will perform Sorabji&#39;s most famous\nwork, Opus Clavice=\r\nmbalisticum. In the past few years, Mr Powell has\nestablished himself as on=\r\ne of the major champions of Sorabji&#39;s music. His\n&quot;First Sorabji Series&quot; in =\r\nLondon included a number of major works, including\nthe Concerto per Suonare=\r\n da me Solo, the 4th Piano Sonata, &quot;Villa Tasca&quot;,\n&quot;Passeggiata veneziana&quot; a=\r\nnd Toccata No. 1, all of which he has recorded for\nAltarus Records. The fir=\r\nst three CDs are available now, the next will be\nreleased in mid-2004, and =\r\ntwo more will follow later in 2004.\n\nOpus Clavicembalisticum stands a littl=\r\ne apart from the predominant trends of\nSorabji&#39;s compositional career, whil=\r\ne including many of the forms and styles\nthat he particularly espoused (Pas=\r\nsacaglia, Theme and Variations, Fugue). A\nfugue sequence, admittedly indebt=\r\ned to the example of Busoni&#39;s great\nFantasia contrappuntistica, O.C. is tig=\r\nhtly organised in a multiple-movement\nstructure of a kind not typical of So=\r\nrabji&#39;s large-scale works. A remarkable\nfeature of O.C., in common with the=\r\n other extended works of Sorabji that\nhave so far been performed, is the de=\r\ngree to which it grips listeners,\nwhether they be newcomers to the composer=\r\n&#39;s music or long time enthusiasts.\nThis despite its unusual timescale (for =\r\na solo piano work), of substantially\nmore than 4 hours. Apparently paradoxi=\r\ncally, many listeners have commented\nthat the work seems dramatically compr=\r\nessed, and that the passage of time is\nirrelevant. \n\nMr Powell performed Op=\r\nus Clavicembalisticum in September at London&#39;s Purcell\nRoom, South Bank Cen=\r\ntre, to a packed audience which afforded him an\nenthusiastic standing ovati=\r\non at the end. He has plans to perform it on a\nnumber of occasions in the U=\r\nK and USA in 2004 and 2005.\n\n\n\nSee concert flyer:\nhttp://www.altarusrecords=\r\n.com/ConcertflyersJune%2004.html\n\n\nOn June 17th at 8pm, Donna Amato will gi=\r\nve the world premi=E8re of Sorabji&#39;s\nPiano Symphony No. 5. The shortest of =\r\nhis symphonies for solo piano, this\npiece nevertheless weighs in at an impr=\r\nessive 2 hours or more. A major work\nof Sorabji&#39;s later years (composed in =\r\n1973), the 5th Piano Symphony is\ndivided into movements which include many =\r\nof the composer&#39;s trademark forms:\nan extended &#39;tropical nocturne&#39; slow mov=\r\nement, two fast toccata-like\nmovements, a fully worked fugue leading to an =\r\nimmense coda stretta (followed\nby an unexpected epilogue which heightens th=\r\ne tension already established by\nthe fugue), all preceded by the familiar e=\r\nxpository first movement in vastly\nexpanded sonata form which (as it turns =\r\nout, now that the large-scale works\nare beginning to become more familiar) =\r\nis typical of Sorabji&#39;s symphonic and\nsonata structures of his mature caree=\r\nr.\n\nDonna Amato has made a special study of Sorabji&#39;s music, and has perfor=\r\nmed\nand recorded a number of world premi=E8res to great public and critical=\r\n\nacclaim. In March, 2003 she gave the world premi=E8re of Sorabji&#39;s 5th Pia=\r\nno\nConcerto, with the Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ed\n=\r\nSpanjaard. The concert was broadcast on Netherlands Public Radio. Her\nrecor=\r\nding of shorter solo piano works of Sorabji (Altarus AIR-CD-9025) makes\nan =\r\nideal introduction to the composer&#39;s music for listeners unfamiliar with\nhi=\r\ns highly individual style, and affords an opportunity to hear a selection\no=\r\nf his most accessible works, played with the requisite effortless\nvirtuosit=\r\ny. She has also recorded other works of Sorabji, Alistair Hinton,\nEdward Ma=\r\ncDowell, Ethelbert and Arthur Nevin and Ronald Stevenson (for\nAltarus) and =\r\nDutilleux, Balakirev and MacDowell (for Olympia).\n\nSee concert flyer.\n\n(for=\r\n music techies:\nReinier Van Houdt in the Canadian new music mag &quot;Musicworks=\r\n&quot; says the\nfollowing about Sorabji &quot;Horizontal juxtapositions of 8 to 12 pi=\r\ntches may\nspan more than 3 octaves and often seem pasted together from frag=\r\nments of\ncommon scales. (Reiterated juxtapositions within an octave, sugges=\r\ntive of\ncommon scales, rarely exist.) Busoni-like vertical juxtapositions o=\r\nf pitches\ncreate open-ended branching chains of random inner harmonies, as =\r\nthough by a\nprocess of fractal arborescence.)\n\n\n\n"

As you rightly suggested, this is a bug, not\na feature of the piece.\n\nTo request help from anyone who might be interested in order to\nconfirm that this is indeed a Scala issue rather than a coding error\non my part, I&#39;m posting my Scala .seq files both for this version with\ntwo timbres, and for another version with a single timbre, as well as\na score of the piece in PostScript (conversions to PDF or other\nformats warmly invited).\n\n  &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminap.seq&gt; (two-timbre version&gt;\n  &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminaf.seq&gt; (one-timbre version&gt;\n  &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminap.ps&gt;  (PostScript score)\n\nAlso, here&#39;s a MIDI of the one-timbre version that, when I proofread\nthe text representation of the output from Scala with midi2txt, seems\nto avoid the glitch that you&#39;ve so helpfully reported, Robert:\n\n  &lt;http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminaf.mid&gt; (one-timbre version&gt;\n\nWhat seems to be happening is that, indeed as you have described, a\n&quot;drone&quot; is resulting when a note G3 in the tenor part at 7 seconds\ninto the piece (the second minim or half note of the fourth measure in\nthe score, since at this tempo each minim or half note takes a\nsecond), or 3360 Scala units (each quarter note or crotchet is 240,\nand each minim 480) gets a note on using MIDI channel 15, without a\nnote off on this channel. Rather, the channel gets used again for a\nanother note, which should be in a different timbre -- but without a\nnote off for G3.\n\nFor these examples I used Scala 1.41 for MS-DOS, and I&#39;m not sure if\nversions for other platforms, especially more recent ones, might avoid\nthis glitch.\n\nWhether we&#39;re documenting a possible anomaly with Scala 1.41 for DOS,\nor simply a glitch in my coding, thanks to you, Robert, and to anyone\nelse who might assist in this process.\n\nA musical aside: in the 1980&#39;s, I once played with a group where we\ndecided to have me provide a drone on hurdy-gurdy for a 16th-century\nFrench chanson in four parts. My first reaction was that it would\ncause dissonances not precisely according to the standard rules of\ncounterpoint, but in practice it was quite effective.\n\nHere, however, the drone resulted from a glitch of some kind, although\nyour remarks suggest it might make an interesting &quot;aleatory&quot; effect,\nsomething I&#39;d like to hear.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n\n"

As I kinda don&#39;t &quot;get them,&quot; or &quot;how they work.&quot;\n\nMy approach to microtonalisim is best described like this..    I was once in \na studio of inter related media program at a local art school..   I explained \nto them that the music I was presenting to them had 6 times as many notes as \nwhat they where used to.. and that, well you know.. more is better...   Someone \nthought this was an expression of American Excess....   and challenged me on \nit, saying &quot;you know matt, sometimes more isn&#39;t better&quot; to which I replied..   \nwell yes it is...   it&#39;s a question of tonal fidelity.. and when he asked why \nI didn&#39;t use a scale with more then 72 notes, I explained to him that that \nnumber doesn&#39;t include the auxiliary notes...   at that was pretty much the end \nof that part of the critique   \n     But I mean.. that&#39;s why I do this.. cause there&#39;s more colors...   and \nmy inner Jungian likes drones I guess.   But I only have about 2 hours worth of \ntheory.. training..   (from a guy I took guitar lessons from who told me he \nwas Matt Menari&#39;s college room mate..)\n     Well I think modern electronic music sorta changes things in terms of \nhow one develops, right?   I mean you don&#39;t have to wait around to train some \nband to play what you just wrote.. and I suppose that modifies the roll of \ntheory.. but the point is I lurk around these parts and others...    and I don&#39;t \nreally understand much of what&#39;s going on..   And I&#39;m the only one (out side of \ncyber land) I know who is mad enough to do this sort of stuff...   and you \nknow what Freud said was the difference between the neurotic and the normal \nperson?   The neurotic&#39;s isolated..   \n     Anyway...   I saw that there La monte Young Well tuned piano tuning \nthing.. but it didn&#39;t really make much sense to me...   I&#39;d like to be able to use \nthat tuning in cubase, perhaps in the komplete instruments to, but I don&#39;t \nreally know much about how to go about that.. and I was looking for guidance... \nthinking that there might be some folks around these parts who know about \nthese things...\n     I was also wondering....   Are there places to go for information on \nmicrotonal artists, and what&#39;s going on with this sort of thing?   In part \nbecause I&#39;m interested and in part because I plan to release a CD soon and am \nwondering how to reach an audience..\n     Also..   seeing that I hear rumors that such an audience exists, what \nare the values of this audience?   I understand that as an artist making art.. \nif you dream of being supported by an audience.. it&#39;s a good idea to have \nsomething to say in relationship to said audiences values.. (this was supposed to \nbe a funny joke, but it didn&#39;t quiet work out)\n     well, ty for your tolerance and patience and stuff\n\n\n     Mr Thustra   AKA matt searles\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"

It can load tuning files \nand export them to the NI synths (which cannot, to my knowledge, load \nthese files by themselves and thus make you enter each tuning you \nwant to use manually).

Well, I&#39;m glad to have you!\n\nFirst off, you&#39;ve got a lot of info in one blast, so I don&#39;t know that it \nwill all get answered right off the bat, but I&#39;ll give some quick thoughts...\n\nAs Paolo sort of implied, it is always nice when talking about your working \nscenario if you mention your platform (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.). This will \nhelp us give you only pertinent data/apps/ideas, etc.\n\n&gt;Anyway, I just bought me a copy of that there Komplete 2...   and I happen to\n&gt;note that the good people of NI seem to have put an awful lot of tuning\n&gt;abilities into there software instruments.\n\nGood things can be done with some of the synths they offer - I hope some of \nthe NI users will chime in. I&#39;ve been trying to get Absynth to use a really \nopen tuning system, rather than a built-in set of scales or internal tuning \neditor. We&#39;ll see how we go. But I believe FM7 has the broadest support.\n\n&gt;My approach to microtonalisim is best described like this...\n\nI think one of the best aspects of microtonality, as it stands right now \n(and especially WRT computer-based work) is that there is NO &quot;right&quot; way. \nJust on this list, which is tiny compared to a lot of music lists, there \nare many, many ways that people use microtonality to make their music of \npreference. I happen to think that this is a Very Good Thing.\n\n&gt;But I mean.. that&#39;s why I do this.. cause there&#39;s more colors...   and my \n&gt;inner Jungian likes drones I guess.   But I only have about 2 hours worth \n&gt;of theory.. training..   (from a guy I took guitar lessons from who told \n&gt;me he was Matt Menari&#39;s college room mate..)\n\nWelll, Matt Maneri has great cred and is a wonderful musician, all stemming \nfrom his dad Joe. Do a quick Google on Joe Maneri and you should see quite \na bit of info - he has had a profound effect especially in the Boston area.\n\n&gt;Well I think modern electronic music sorta changes things in terms of\n&gt;how one develops, right?\n\nYep.\n\n&gt;I mean you don&#39;t have to wait around to train some band to play what you \n&gt;just wrote.. and I suppose that modifies the roll of theory.. but the \n&gt;point is I lurk around these parts and others...    and I don&#39;t really \n&gt;understand much of what&#39;s going on.\n\nYou aren&#39;t the only one! But you can ask, and if it doesn&#39;t get answered \nhere (esp. if it is more along the lines of microtonal theory) there are \nplaces we can point to so that you can get up to speed on that end as well.\n\n&gt;And I&#39;m the only one (out side of cyber land) I know who is mad enough to \n&gt;do this sort of stuff...\n\nMicrotonality is one of the last areas where - in music at least - you can \nreally chart a new course. And it is pretty much the intrepid explorers who \ndo this. Revel in your loneliness! :)\n\n&gt;I was also wondering....   Are there places to go for information on \n&gt;microtonal artists, and what&#39;s going on with this sort of thing? In part \n&gt;because I&#39;m interested and in part because I plan to release a CD soon and \n&gt;am wondering how to reach an audience..\n\nThere isn&#39;t really a &#39;clearinghouse&#39; of information. Be sure to check on \nthe links page, the listing of music that is already out on the net. I \nwouldn&#39;t be surprised if you contacted musicians that are represented there \nthat you would get msgs back about how they go as to spreading their music. \nBut we/they are still a very small niche. It will take time. But if you dig \na bit, you might be surprised how many different people, in a large number \nof ways, are using alternative tunings to make very new music.\n\n&gt;Also..   seeing that I hear rumors that such an audience exists, what are \n&gt;the values of this audience?\n\nImpossible to say. I don&#39;t really know for a fact that an audience exists, \ncertainly not along the lines of more traditional (either classical or pop \nor ?) music audiences.\n\n&gt;well, ty for your tolerance and patience and stuff\n\nThis list doesn&#39;t move at light speed, so patience is kinda built-in...\n\nCheers,\nJon (aka ListMom) \n\n\n\n"

Well known is the attempt by Alois H�ba. He was aware that in order \nto preproduce native songs of his countrymen in Czechoslovakia he needed a \nfiner grain, so to speak, and therefore he halved the equal semitones. He \ntried to use quarter-tones. However, it is clear that by simply adding 12 \nmore notes between the existing 12 notes one cannot improve the harmonic \nrelationships and the musical quality of the original 12 notes. What one \nneeds for improvement is not quarter-tones but fifths of tones - the system \nHuygens used.\n \tAgain, Bela Bart�k, the Hungarian composer who died in 1945 in the United \nStates, recognizing the value of the Hungarian peasant music both as a living \ntradition and as a source of inspiration for modern music, stated that he \nover and over again met the interval of the harmonic seventh and that he \ntherefore laid at the bottom, as a basic foundation for music, a chord of \nfour notes, adding the perfect seventh to the common chord. Bart�k&#39;s \ntestimony carries great weight, for he was one of the very greatest modern \ncomposers. Therefore, for the evolution of music, it is very urgent that we \nfind an equal temperament suitable for the reproduction of Bart�k&#39;s \nfundamental chord, which may be specified by the harmonic numbers 4:5:6:7. \nThe &quot;tricesimoprimal&quot; equal temperament discovered by Huygens 3 centuries ago \nfulfills the requirement...&quot;\n\n\nnow I&#39;m really interested in perusing Bart�k&#39;s  output for two violins, (the \n44 duos), which nicely blurs the distinction between the classical style of \nplaying, and the earthier &#39;fiddle&#39; style.....\n\n-Aaron\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n"

A nice tradoff, if you ask me.\n\nI&#39;m one of those individuals who tends to think the boundary is, and should \nbe, blurry between n-tets and JI.\n\nAnyway, I don&#39;t buy any of the JI metaphysics, even though I love JI, and have \nused it, I can&#39;t seem to bring myself to be religious about it. It&#39;s all in \nwhat you want to do, I guess. I miss the open-ended approach to tuning that \nseems to have characterized &#39;Xenharmonikon&#39; as contrasted with the &#39;don&#39;t \nwrite an article for us unless you stay away from references to non-just \ntunings&#39; attitude of 1/1 and the JI Network.\n\nPersonally, I think there are plenty of interesting sounding intervals (an \ninfinite number of them, to be precise) that ought *not* be ruled out of \ncomposition because they have no rational representation, including those \nthat come from non n-tets (like the interval of phi). Just me, I suppose, but \nI guess I like the idea of *not* limiting one&#39;s compositional resources based \non an a-priori conviction.\n\nHell, I don&#39;t even rule out 12-tet !!!! (some here clearly do, and I&#39;ve even \nfelt bored by it, but I think it would be silly to say I never want to hear \nany music that&#39;s in 12-tet again!) Jazz, for instance, is made for 12-tet.\n\nBesides, trying to eliminate beating from say, a basic triad like 4:5:6 is not \nalways right for a given composition. I would argue that it&#39;s not right for a \ntremendous amount of music: most Western music throughout history, and almost \nall non-Western music (with the exception perhaps of Indian sub-continental \nmusic, which not coincidentally, is harmonically static).\n\nAs a composer, I find an n-tet convenient: I like to transpose and modulate, \netc. and have the intervallic sound remain consistent. That intervallic \nconsistency is often desirable to me. How close an approximation I want, and \nwhat n-tet I pick, depends on the *mood* of the piece. JI has a mood, and \neven different moods depending on the tuning, but sometimes it&#39;s just to \nstatic for me, and an n-tet will have to be done. (Yes, I&#39;m consciously \nsiding with Darreg here--why not be a tuning omnivore?)\n\nSo I advocate *not* closing *any* doors. Why do people always have to pick \nfights about n-tet vs. JI? Seems silly to me....Just me though ;)\n\n-Aaron.\n\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n"

It isn&#39;t even bad for quite a\nfew 11 limit intervals and by it use i was able to chart out what it was that\ninterested me. For this reason they are quite useful.\n    I do object to Darreg&#39;s notion the JI has a mood. It doesn&#39;t have any such\nthing as it encompasses an infinite array of intervals in just as many\nconfigurations. On the other hand i do find that ET&#39;s do have moods that sooner\nor later present themselves. Et&#39;s are a closed system and that is a fact not an\nopinion. The only way to escape them is to abandon them.\n    Et &#39;s also have allot in common with electronic music. The most sucessful (\nas one can notice in much of the black music use of it ) is most successful when\nthe timbre are changed all the time. With both that way one avoid the the\nlistener from really hearing exactly what is there and one uses the contrast\nbetween the various elements use as the basis of saying what one wishes.\n\n\n&quot;Aaron K.

Could it be as simple as that?\n\nWhy yes !! Good point ;)\n\n&gt; &gt;Besides, trying to eliminate beating from say, a basic triad like 4:5:6 is\n&gt; &gt;not\n&gt; &gt;always right for a given composition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Um, I didn&#39;t say it had to be JI - I just happen to not like the idea of x\n&gt; number of equal steps.\n\nAh! Ok...so you like irrational but unequal tunings? Temperings?\n\n&gt; &gt;As a composer, I find an n-tet convenient: I like to transpose and\n&gt; &gt; modulate, etc. and have the intervallic sound remain consistent.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve never quite figured that out, unless it is self-pleasure: if the\n&gt; intervalic sound remains consistent, what is the point of modulation? In\n&gt; tempering, one could attain differing feels with the differing keys, IIRC.\n\nWell, there&#39;s still what happens to a theme or what have you by being higher \nor lower...granted there&#39;s not as much contrast as in a tempering, but it \nhasn&#39;t prevented a tremendous amunt of great music from being written, has \nit?\n\n&gt; Frankly, it makes more sense to me to compose with multiple tunings - now\n&gt; *thats* modulation. I quickly add that I don&#39;t have the chops to compose\n&gt; like that yet.\n\nThat is cool. I think I&#39;d rather master what I&#39;m doing in one tuning first !\n\n\n&gt; &gt;So I advocate *not* closing *any* doors.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree as well. But I would also, when speaking about representing certain\n&gt; musics of the world, delve a little deeper into tunings than pick a\n&gt; convenient ET. As always (as often?) I could be wrong, but I&#39;d be willing\n&gt; to bet there are few indigenous musics that actually use an ET; I&#39;m much\n&gt; more willing to think that is Western microtonal/academic culture at work.\n\nWell, at least you know you have a bias...but I think you may be right. But \nnot being an indigenous composer, I don&#39;t know that I would throw away ET&#39;s \njust because a folk culture doesn&#39;t use it. Might as well throw out my synth \nas well....(Kraig Grady might llike that idea ;)  )\n\n&gt; &gt;Why do people always have to pick fights about n-tet vs. JI? Seems silly\n&gt; &gt;to me....Just me though ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Didn&#39;t mean for it to be a fight at all, just my way of showing *my*\n&gt; particular respect for music of other cultures/tunings. And I really don&#39;t\n&gt; want to start any conflagration, so I&#39;ll just end with those statements,\n&gt; and any ignorances they may contain are purely my own.\n\nDoesn&#39;t sound like ignorance to me as much as statement of preference...\n\nCheers,\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n"

It isn&#39;t even bad\n&gt; for quite a few 11 limit intervals and by it use i was able to chart out\n&gt; what it was that interested me. For this reason they are quite useful.\n\nhmmm... I have no problem with the meantone 2nd. OTOH, sometimes I *do* have a \nproblem with not being able to use the triad built on D major in a C \nmajor-based tuning because of the D-A fifth sucking!! I stress the \n*sometimes* (as you know, I&#39;m fond of Centaur, for instance, for many uses) I \nknow the JI argument: write differently !!! I can and do: sometimes. But when \nI want the D major chord to sound just dandy, I chose not to use JI. It&#39;s \npractical for me: I don&#39;t have time and money to get into alternate keyboards \nor hand-made instruments, etc.\n\nI wish I did!\n\nBut still, I don&#39;t believe that Bach *works* in JI. And I don&#39;t believe I want \nto cut Bach from my diet, or any Bach-like music, or Renaissance 1/4 comma \nmeantone (or much of Western music history) on a technicality related to an \na-priori attachment to JI !! \n\n&gt;     I do object to Darreg&#39;s notion the JI has a mood. It doesn&#39;t have any\n&gt; such thing as it encompasses an infinite array of intervals in just as many\n&gt; configurations. On the other hand i do find that ET&#39;s do have moods that\n&gt; sooner or later present themselves. Et&#39;s are a closed system and that is a\n&gt; fact not an opinion. The only way to escape them is to abandon them.\n\nWell, I could turn the tables on this argument: If you have an infinite array \nof intervals, presumably to keep them from beating, where is your contrast?\nThe contrast you speak of applies to JI&#39;s limitations within a finite set of \npitches, no? Or to an unequal temperament. Modulation from one beatless chord \nto another is as contrast-less as from one slightly beating chord to another, \nas in ET&#39;s, no?\n\nIf one is not interested in limiting oneself, one shouldn&#39;t stick to *only* \nJI, but either mix tunings as Jon suggests, or use the infinite spectrum of \nintervals, and include the irrationals as well, of which there is an even \ngreater infinity, as Cantor proved (athough you could argue that the ear \nhears only a finite practical subset of any infinite set of usable intervals)\n\nStravinsky said he liked to compose with a sense of knowing the limits of what \nhe was working with. In fact he said he couldn&#39;t compose without limits. In a \nsense, I agree with his sentiment. As you do too, in practice. You pick the \nlimits of Eikosany. I pick, say 19-tet or 31-tet. I&#39;m througly convinced \ngreat music can be written in any tuning whatsoever ;)\n\nIt seems awfully severe to &#39;abandon&#39; or dimiss any music making based on ET&#39;s \nto me....that&#39;s fine though, if that&#39;s your personal mission, to write great \nstuff as you have, based on that philosophy. I just know it&#39;s not my path to \nreject, but to remain open and explore. I will say however, that in the \ninterest of getting down to writing, it helps to pick a path to explore and \nstick to it--one of the maddening things about tuning is how many great \npossibilities there are--perhaps this is what Stravinsky was talking about \nwhen he talked about picking limits !!\n\nAnyway, I find that JI does have a certain &#39;mood&#39; to me: to my ears, it&#39;s hard \nnot to sound New Age writing in JI, something I&#39;m keen to avoid. Most, not \nall music written in JI comes across as having a static-contemplative-relaxed\nvibe, and that&#39;s fine if you want it, but it&#39;s not the only thing I want my \nmusic to express. I certainly love JI tunings that are rich in beating, in \nwhich case, for me, it seems absurd to insist that the beating be derived \nfrom rational tuning designed to eliminate beating for other intervals !!\n\nI don&#39;t know...I rarely judge music based on its technical features, which are \na means to an end. Tuning to me is a technical feature, not an end in itself.\nIf the music moves me, I don&#39;t care what tuning it&#39;s in, although I prefer the \notherness of *any* alternate tuning for the variety it would offer from \n12-tet.....but even 12-tet is fine for me many times. Why be reactionary?\nShould I stop listening to Stravinsky&#39;s music in 12-tet? I *like* being an \nomnivore !\n\nWhat about electronic music with no apparantly clear tuning at all? (&#39;Silver \nApples of the Moon&#39; of Morton Subotnick) Is it not good because it doesn&#39;t \nhave a array of clear pitches to start with, and is it even worse for the \npitches not being JI?\n\n&gt;     Et &#39;s also have allot in common with electronic music. The most\n&gt; sucessful ( as one can notice in much of the black music use of it ) is\n&gt; most successful when the timbre are changed all the time. With both that\n&gt; way one avoid the the listener from really hearing exactly what is there\n&gt; and one uses the contrast between the various elements use as the basis of\n&gt; saying what one wishes.\n\nHey: I think that&#39;s true, but I think hearing a wide variety of electronic \ntimbres in a short span *can* be very overwhelmingly interesting !!!\n\nBest,\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n"

Szanto wrote:\n&gt; Aaron,\n&gt;\n&gt; No, there *won&#39;t* be another tuning war - I&#39;ll see to that! :)\n&gt;\n&gt; I did want to address one point, which I am indelibly connected with:\n&gt;\n&gt; {you wrote...}\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, I find that JI does have a certain &#39;mood&#39; to me: to my ears, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;hard\n&gt; &gt;not to sound New Age writing in JI, something I&#39;m keen to avoid. Most, not\n&gt; &gt;all music written in JI comes across as having a\n&gt; &gt; static-contemplative-relaxed vibe, and that&#39;s fine if you want it, but\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not the only thing I want my music to express.\n&gt;\n&gt; This statement flies in the face of the entire output of one guy, Harry\n&gt; Partch. I defy anyone to find a piece that Partch composed that sounds &quot;new\n&gt; age&quot;! And while there are, here and there, either a piece, movement, or\n&gt; section of a large work - usually by necessity of the dramatic needs\n&gt; (staged works) - that creates a static or inert mood, it does so purposely.\n\nTrue enough, but I would point out that Partch used an awful lot of \ninstruments with percussive decay lengths! It&#39;s hard to sound New Age with \npercussion.\n\nWell, even the stuff I&#39;m batting at as being New Age-ey, I sort of \nlike--Riley, Young, Robert Rich....\n\nIts an internal love-hate thing for me I guess.\n\n&gt; I would also point out a composer like Kyle Gann, who has written music\n&gt; that explores a lot of the dissonances that can be found in an expanded JI\n&gt; system.\n\nThat&#39;s true. Iwould still question why one would go for JI *exclusively* if \none were interested in dissonance, though. I see no reason to think \nlow-numbered rational intervals make dissonance any better than they \nconsonance. (i.e. I have to agree with McLaren that the subjective idea of \nconsonance and dissonance is not so simple as the ratio idea)\n\n&gt; Again: I did not mean to start or rehash anything. And your earlier post\n&gt; nailed it quite well - this is just my take on things. I liken it very much\n&gt; to visual arts: how many paintings have you seen with equal-spaced\n&gt; gridmarks on them? :)\n\nCute analogy, but one that doesn&#39;t work long for me--you would have to prove \nthat pitch space maps to grid space on a canvas. I don&#39;t think visual arts \nand music can be quite literally mapped at all together without drastically \nchanging the nature of either.....first of all, music has a grammer and \ntemporality.....well, let&#39;s not get into it, but you see my point ! ;)\n\nMy final word is that ET&#39;s are useful to me, to avoid drowning in thousands of \nratios, comma drift, etc. while still getting something of that JI &#39;purity&#39;, \nand the added feature of interesting &#39;impurity&#39;.

Those slightly flattened fifths don&#39;t sound quite the same as \nJI fifths.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m one of those individuals who tends to think the boundary is, \nand should \n&gt; be, blurry between n-tets and JI.\n\nObviously its going to blur when you get to an accurate enough et. I \nthink 171-et, for 7-limit music, sounds JI; probably other people \nwould set the boundry elsewhere. 99-et is just enough detuned that it \nhas a sound one might well prefer over JI.\n\n&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t buy any of the JI metaphysics, even though I love \nJI, and have \n&gt; used it, I can&#39;t seem to bring myself to be religious about it.\n\nWhere the warfare becomes almost religious is right at the boundry \nbetween just and nearly just; the ennealimmal systems, such as 171,\n270, 441 or 612 are more or less JI, but suggesting that a JI \nproponent give one of these a try can land you in hot water.\n\n&gt; Personally, I think there are plenty of interesting sounding \nintervals (an \n&gt; infinite number of them, to be precise) that ought *not* be ruled \nout of \n&gt; composition because they have no rational representation, including \nthose \n&gt; that come from non n-tets (like the interval of phi).\n\nThere are an infinite number of real numbers; to say that means there \nare an infinite number of musical intervals requires a leap of \nidentification.\n\n&gt; So I advocate *not* closing *any* doors. Why do people always have \nto pick \n&gt; fights about n-tet vs. JI? Seems silly to me....Just me though ;)\n\nA quest for truth in music, maybe.\n\n\n"

Also, it\nseems a topic more suited to the tuning list than MMM.  Though\nI find it heartening that it has thus far remained civil here.\nLet&#39;s see what I can do to change that.  :)\n\nWhen comparing two things, such as &quot;ETs&quot; and &quot;JI&quot;, it helps to\nhave some idea of what those things are.  Perhaps Jon and Aaron\nhave a mutual understanding of the definitions I&#39;m not aware of,\nbut ultimately it seems &quot;ETs&quot; = irrational numbers, while\n&quot;JI&quot; = rational numbers.  If this is the case, a comparison\nbetween the two is pointless, as there is no practical difference\nwith respect to music.  Any irrational can be approximated as\nclosely as one likes with the rational numbers and vice versa.\n\nSomeone said something about ETs being closed systems, while\nJI is an open system.  Not true.  Any single ET is closed, but\nso is any single JI scale.  The possible variety of either\n*class* of tunings is infinite.\n\nSo what is meant by this age-old debate?  My guess is that\nthrough some accident of history, a particular style associated\nitself with JI, while another style associated itself with ET.\nAnd the two styles, for some other reason, are really just into\narguing with one another -- the content of the argument is\nsecondary -- and &#39;ETs&quot; vs. JI&#39; is just a welcome focal point.\n\nOr perhaps what is meant is: &#39;low-numbered ETs&#39; vs. &#39;high-limit\nJI&#39;.  Or maybe it&#39;s: &#39;12-tET vs. 5-limit JI&#39;.  Or maybe it&#39;s:\n&#39;tunings that approximate JI&#39; vs. &#39;tunings that don&#39;t try to\napproximate JI&#39;.  Or perhaps it&#39;s: &#39;people who think 2-cent\nerrors are acceptable&#39; vs. &#39;people who think 0.0002-cent errors\nare acceptable&#39;.\n\nBut if it is any of those things, why not just use those terms\ninstead of &#39;ETs vs. JI&#39;?  A little clarity goes a long way.\n\nYours,\n\n-Carl\n\n\n"

Szanto wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; This statement flies in the face of the entire output of one guy, \nHarry\n&gt; &gt; Partch. I defy anyone to find a piece that Partch composed that \nsounds &quot;new\n&gt; &gt; age&quot;! And while there are, here and there, either a piece, \nmovement, or\n&gt; &gt; section of a large work - usually by necessity of the dramatic \nneeds\n&gt; &gt; (staged works) - that creates a static or inert mood, it does so \npurposely.\n&gt; \n&gt; True enough, but I would point out that Partch used an awful lot of \n&gt; instruments with percussive decay lengths! It&#39;s hard to sound New \nAge with \n&gt; percussion.\n\nOne thing n-et makes it easy to do is the endlessly modulating effect \nthat was driving both of you nuts with my last piece. If all of your \navailable chords are closely tied harmonically, you are kind of like \na dog on a leash instead of one running wild through the neighborhood \npooping on lawns. That does tend to create an element of stasis. With \ntemperament, and especially equal temperament, you have &quot;puns&quot; which \nallow the dog to go a little crazy.\n&gt; Well, even the stuff I&#39;m batting at as being New Age-ey, I sort of \n&gt; like--Riley, Young, Robert Rich....\n&gt; \n&gt; Its an internal love-hate thing for me I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would also point out a composer like Kyle Gann, who has written \nmusic\n&gt; &gt; that explores a lot of the dissonances that can be found in an \nexpanded JI\n&gt; &gt; system.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s true. Iwould still question why one would go for JI \n*exclusively* if \n&gt; one were interested in dissonance, though. I see no reason to think \n&gt; low-numbered rational intervals make dissonance any better than \nthey \n&gt; consonance. (i.e. I have to agree with McLaren that the subjective \nidea of \n&gt; consonance and dissonance is not so simple as the ratio idea)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again: I did not mean to start or rehash anything. And your \nearlier post\n&gt; &gt; nailed it quite well - this is just my take on things. I liken it \nvery much\n&gt; &gt; to visual arts: how many paintings have you seen with equal-spaced\n&gt; &gt; gridmarks on them? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cute analogy, but one that doesn&#39;t work long for me--you would have \nto prove \n&gt; that pitch space maps to grid space on a canvas. I don&#39;t think \nvisual arts \n&gt; and music can be quite literally mapped at all together without \ndrastically \n&gt; changing the nature of either.....first of all, music has a grammer \nand \n&gt; temporality.....well, let&#39;s not get into it, but you see my \npoint ! ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; My final word is that ET&#39;s are useful to me, to avoid drowning in \nthousands of \n&gt; ratios, comma drift, etc. while still getting something of that \nJI &#39;purity&#39;, \n&gt; and the added feature of interesting &#39;impurity&#39;.

In each section, at least one but no more \nthan three examples of what to download, and how to set it up on the \nplatform. A basic template would be the names of the software and links to \ndownloads; followed by a description of how to install, and use, those \npieces of software to get a simple piece of microtonal music recorded.\n\nI want to start, if possible, with a freeware solution for each platform. \nIf consensus is that there simply isn&#39;t a good way to do that, then we go \nto shareware, donation-ware, or low cost commercial products. By the time \nwe put something up that newcomers can refer to, we should have two \nsections: free, and low-cost. That way we can show there is no barrier \n(save the hardware) to making music (that is, if we do indeed find free \nresources for all 3 platforms) as well as show the benefits to creativity, \nquality, work-flow, etc., with the expenditure of just a little bit of money.\n\nI&#39;d even entertain a Wild Card page/sub-section of standalone things that \nmake something microtonal on their own (I happen to be thinking of Robert \nWalker&#39;s &quot;Fractal Tune Smithy&quot;). But only after the main goal is achieved.\n\nFinal Important Note [FIN]: I would like anyone who submits a particular \nscenario to have ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IT! It won&#39;t do us any good to just \nsurf and say &quot;this looks good&quot;. I want you to have created a \nstraight-forward solution on your own, and know in fact that it works [with \nthe usual caveats that tweaking may be needed in terms of sound card, i/o \nif you want to do midi, etc... but you get the picture].\n\nIsn&#39;t this really a doable thing? Wouldn&#39;t it be great, when we have \nsomeone who is asking about sitting down and finding out about \nmicrotonality, to be able to point to that one page and say &quot;Here are a \nnumber of solutions - give it a go!&quot;?\n\nI think so. I welcome commentary on this, and then after a bit of \ndiscussion we&#39;ll plunge forward, set a deadline, and see what we come up \nwith...\n\nCheers,\nListMom\n\n\n\n"

Leave it to you to come up with that! Well, it is a clever analog, \nprobably no closer to painting/ET comparisons than anything, but worthy of \nconsideration. Sure, there are times when absolute grid-like rhythmic \nconstructs work for me; for instance, contemporary dance music (trance, \nelectronica) seems perfectly suited, esp. since most of it is \ncomputer-derived, not to mention that the regularity of the beat makes it \neasier on Western youth to find the rhythm.\n\nBut even when one constructs, ahead of time, a 16th-note rhythm, there are \nalways - when it sounds good to me - subtle inflections of time. A good \nexample would be to listen to a samba pattern played by a college \npercussion ensemble (that has never learned Brazilian music) and then the \nsame stuff played by Brazillians. You&#39;d need lots of beams and dots to \nadequately notate the feel they give to the pattern. Lots of musical \ncultures could be looked at this way.\n\nFor insight into how much someone might care in the *opposite* direction, \nalbeit in a creative vein, check out at your leisure the nano-correction of \ntempo and other aspects done by BT in some of his music:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/33u25\n\nI know you were being sly in your response, but it does cause me pause: \nthere *is* symmetry in nature, and there are instances of &quot;equality&quot; that I \nlike. But words sometimes fail when discussing the deepest aspect of the \nart(s) we love. I initially loved the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, certainly \nnot shy of straight lines and even spacing (at times); it kind of fell by \nthe wayside when I discovered the work of Charles Rennie Macintosh, who \ncombined similar elements with more rounded and organic structures. A \nperfect blend, for me.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

Johnson&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I could turn the tables on this argument: If you have an infinite array\n&gt; of intervals, presumably to keep them from beating, where is your contrast?\n\nIt is by JI that i am able to tune my beats to do exactly what i want them to do.\nJust because one uses bricks, one does not have to always make rectangles and\nchimneys\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The contrast you speak of applies to JI&#39;s limitations within a finite set of\n&gt; pitches, no? Or to an unequal temperament. Modulation from one beatless chord\n&gt; to another is as contrast-less as from one slightly beating chord to another,\n&gt; as in ET&#39;s, no?\n\nyou are making an assumption about users of JI\n\n&gt; If one is not interested in limiting oneself, one shouldn&#39;t stick to *only*\n&gt; JI, but either mix tunings as Jon suggests, or use the infinite spectrum of\n&gt; intervals, and include the irrationals as well, of which there is an even\n&gt; greater infinity, as Cantor proved (athough you could argue that the ear\n&gt; hears only a finite practical subset of any infinite set of usable intervals)\n\nIn reality each type of continuum is infinite and at a certain point\nindistinguishable\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stravinsky said he liked to compose with a sense of knowing the limits of what\n&gt; he was working with. In fact he said he couldn&#39;t compose without limits. In a\n&gt; sense, I agree with his sentiment. As you do too, in practice. You pick the\n&gt; limits of Eikosany. I pick, say 19-tet or 31-tet.\n\nyet the history of music is more about setting new horizons that putting one self\nin a cage. but could you stand doing only 19 for say 5 years and nothing else,\nand if not why?\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; I&#39;m througly convinced\n&gt; great music can be written in any tuning whatsoever ;)\n\nI believe so too. It is in the long term that i am concerned. I have no wish to\nconstruct new walls for future development.\n\n&gt; It seems awfully severe to &#39;abandon&#39; or dimiss any music making based on ET&#39;s\n&gt; to me....that&#39;s fine though, if that&#39;s your personal mission, to write great\n&gt; stuff as you have, based on that philosophy.\n\nI recently mentioned some fine ET music i was sent. i don&#39;t dismiss any music but\ndo object to my own experience with how working in such systems make me think.\n\n&gt; I just know it&#39;s not my path to\n&gt; reject, but to remain open and explore. I will say however, that in the\n&gt; interest of getting down to writing, it helps to pick a path to explore and\n&gt; stick to it--one of the maddening things about tuning is how many great\n&gt; possibilities there are--perhaps this is what Stravinsky was talking about\n&gt; when he talked about picking limits !!\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I find that JI does have a certain &#39;mood&#39; to me: to my ears, it&#39;s hard\n&gt; not to sound New Age writing in JI, something I&#39;m keen to avoid.\n\nI suggest you listen to some of Kyle Gann music. Although my last CD might have\nleaned that way, I am for the most part not inclined that direction.  most New\nAge music is written in an ET- 12\n\n&gt; Most, not\n&gt; all music written in JI comes across as having a static-contemplative-relaxed\n&gt; vibe, and that&#39;s fine if you want it, but it&#39;s not the only thing I want my\n&gt; music to express. I certainly love JI tunings that are rich in beating, in\n&gt; which case, for me, it seems absurd to insist that the beating be derived\n&gt; from rational tuning designed to eliminate beating for other intervals !!\n\nas someone who uses beats in live situations , it is by having them tuned  that i\nam able to play unamplified and create sonic effects  from all different\ndirections in the room. Anyone one on these list that have heard me live will\ntestify to that. The thing is that By using JI i could stumble into such a thing,\nwith an ET the structure is always the same and\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know...I rarely judge music based on its technical features, which are\n&gt; a means to an end. Tuning to me is a technical feature, not an end in itself.\n&gt; If the music moves me, I don&#39;t care what tuning it&#39;s in, although I prefer the\n&gt; otherness of *any* alternate tuning for the variety it would offer from\n&gt; 12-tet.....but even 12-tet is fine for me many times. Why be reactionary?\n&gt; Should I stop listening to Stravinsky&#39;s music in 12-tet? I *like* being an\n&gt; omnivore !\n&gt;\n&gt; What about electronic music with no apparantly clear tuning at all? (&#39;Silver\n&gt; Apples of the Moon&#39; of Morton Subotnick) Is it not good because it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; have a array of clear pitches to start with, and is it even worse for the\n&gt; pitches not being JI?\n\n Sidewinder is my favorite of his but he has ruined that by butchering it.\nHe is, by the way, very anti tuning.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey: I think that&#39;s true, but I think hearing a wide variety of electronic\n&gt; timbres in a short span *can* be very overwhelmingly interesting !!!\n\n I completely agree\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Best,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson\n&gt; http://www.dividebypi.com\n&gt; http://www.akjmusic.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- -Kraig Grady\nNorth American Embassy of Anaphoria Island\n http://www.anaphoria.com\nThe Wandering Medicine Show\n KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST\n\n\n"

The only way to escape them is to abandon them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very high number ets all sound alike, since they all sound like JI.\n&gt; As the division number climbs, the theoretical closure also means\n&gt; less and less in practice. When the commas of the system are all so\n&gt; tiny they don&#39;t arise in practice as &quot;puns&quot;, it becomes dubious to\n&gt; draw any distinction between the et and JI. You still get &quot;puns&quot; for\n&gt; 612-equal, but when you get highly accurate systems in the high four\n&gt; digits I think you can forget about the distinction; the same is true\n&gt; for 196608-equal (the midi accuracy limit) for that matter.

Leave it to you to come up with that! Well, it is a clever \nanalog, \n&gt; probably no closer to painting/ET comparisons than anything, but \nworthy of \n&gt; consideration. Sure, there are times when absolute grid-like \nrhythmic \n&gt; constructs work for me; for instance, contemporary dance music \n(trance, \n&gt; electronica) seems perfectly suited, esp. since most of it is \n&gt; computer-derived, not to mention that the regularity of the beat \nmakes it \n&gt; easier on Western youth to find the rhythm.\n&gt; \n&gt; But even when one constructs, ahead of time, a 16th-note rhythm, \nthere are \n&gt; always - when it sounds good to me - subtle inflections of time. A \ngood \n&gt; example would be to listen to a samba pattern played by a college \n&gt; percussion ensemble (that has never learned Brazilian music) and \nthen the \n&gt; same stuff played by Brazillians. You&#39;d need lots of beams and dots \nto \n&gt; adequately notate the feel they give to the pattern. Lots of \nmusical \n&gt; cultures could be looked at this way.\n\nHmmm, it occurred to me that I could also turn the analogy around and \nequate precisely spaced rhythm with JI and subtle inflections of time \nwith micro-tempering and thereby argue that a microtemperament is the \n*best* intonation -- but, I don&#39;t want to start a war on this list, \nso I won&#39;t do that.  ;-)\n\nBut I would equate precisely spaced rhythm with an ET and subtle \ninflections of time with well-temperament and thereby argue that a \nwell-temperament (or alternatively, a rational approximation of a \ndissonant ET) is often better than the ET it&#39;s designed to replace.  \nFor example, I much prefer 13:15:17:20:23 or 12:14:16:18:21 or \n26:30:34:39:45 to 5-ET.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

I&#39;m so sold \non the advantages of these tunings, that if were writing ad copy I \nwould say:  &quot;If you&#39;re looking for fun and adventure in a tuning, \nthen let yourself go -- take a trip down the middle path!&quot;\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

It is called Duo for Duodene, and you\ncan find it at my SoundClick site:\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm\n\nIt is the result of a collaboration between myself and a fellow\nmicrotonalist.  We each created material to use (four small original\nsynthesizer audio clips) and separately recombined the material to formulate\na piece.  Duo for Duodene represents my microtonal partner&#39;s mix.  My own is\nnot finished yet.\n\nYou&#39;ll find it is very different from the other work on my SoundClick site\nbecause the bulk of the work was not done by me (I only provided some\nmaterial), and it uses sounds outside of the FM7.  I think you&#39;ll enjoy it.\n\nFor a tuning, we used Ellis&#39;s Duodene:\n\n0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime\n1:         16/15            111.731 minor diatonic semitone\n2:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone\n3:          6/5             315.641 minor third\n4:          5/4             386.314 major third\n5:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth\n6:         45/32            590.224 diatonic tritone\n7:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth\n8:          8/5             813.686 minor sixth\n9:          5/3             884.359 major sixth, BP sixth\n10:          9/5            1017.596 just minor seventh, BP seventh\n11:         15/8            1088.269 classic major seventh\n12:          2/1            1200.000 octave\n\nI&#39;d be interested in your responses.\n\nThanks!\n\n-Andrew\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.

You&#39;re talking about using a JI system\nnot as a way to create scales, but a way to create whatever sound you need\nin any instance.  This is a new idea for me.\n\nIn my very preliminary experiments in JI, I&#39;ve played some common scales and\nmade a bunch of my own, but I&#39;ve been limited to twelve notes on my software\nsynthesizer.  I have often found that I want an interval above some note of\nthe scale, and it&#39;s not there, while it&#39;s there for a different note.\n\nI think one of the greatest differences between a JI scale and an equal\ntempered scale is this:\n\nIn an equal tempered scale, there are exactly as many different intervals as\nthere are notes to the octave.  Each note of the scale has the ability to\ntravel the distance of any one of those intervals.\n\nIn a JI scale, there are many more intervals than notes in the scale.  Each\nnote has a collection of different intervals it can move in either\ndirection.  It is different among notes.\n\nYou&#39;re talking about a new kind of JI (new for me), one that isn&#39;t bound to\na scale.  In this kind of system, there are infinite possible intervals, and\neach note is capable of traveling the distance of any interval you can think\nof.  Infinity!\n\nWow!\n\nWell, I know I&#39;m not ready for infinity, for a variety or reasons.  I think\nall composers need to set limits for themselves so they don&#39;t go crazy and\ncan make sense of things.  To me, an equal temperament seems like a\nreasonable limit to set.  x number of intervals, x number of notes, each\ninterval available to each note.  An interconnected but not infinite JI\nscale makes sense as a different kind of limit.  Lots of intervals,\ndispersed all over the place.  A limited number of notes and a limited\ncollection of abilities given to each note.  These two kinds of scale\nsatisfy different needs.  They create different limits.  They&#39;re wonderfully\ndifferent.\n\nThanks again for your perspective, Kraig.  It got me thinking.\n\n-Andrew\n\n--- kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Andrew and yes do enjoy your CD!\n&gt;      When i work in JI i am always aware of how i am plowing in a\n&gt; particular\n&gt; field where from each point it is possible to expand further. With Et i am\n&gt; in a\n&gt; closed cycle and there is no way to add anything to it. It is unable to\n&gt; grow. (\n&gt; of course one can always start dividing each temperment into smaller equal\n&gt; divisions).\n&gt;     Partch referred to his 43 tone scale. In actuality he had way more\n&gt; because\n&gt; on any of these degrees he could and would put whole harmonic and\n&gt; subharmonic\n&gt; hexads. The instruments themselves found their own natural way out of the\n&gt; system.\n&gt;     Even if one does not have a particular note for example, it is quite\n&gt; easy\n&gt; to ask any player to play a fifths a fourth or a Just third relations to\n&gt; it\n&gt; without too much trouble.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.

In this respect, JI tunings may not (I \nemphasize *may*) jump out at you as being gigantically different. People \ncan correct me here, but JI has strong roots in its harmonic sense, and \nmelodies grow from that ground. But you should explore as you see fit.\n\nIt would also be a VERY swell thing if we can get you to tackle things not \nlimited to 12 pitches. Seems like you are a better muso than that!\n\nThanks for sharing the new work, and get your Collaboratist to show his/her \nface around here...\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

You&#39;re talking about using a JI system\n&gt; not as a way to create scales, but a way to create whatever sound you need\n&gt; in any instance.  This is a new idea for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my very preliminary experiments in JI, I&#39;ve played some common scales and\n&gt; made a bunch of my own, but I&#39;ve been limited to twelve notes on my software\n&gt; synthesizer.  I have often found that I want an interval above some note of\n&gt; the scale, and it&#39;s not there, while it&#39;s there for a different note.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think one of the greatest differences between a JI scale and an equal\n&gt; tempered scale is this:\n&gt;\n&gt; In an equal tempered scale, there are exactly as many different intervals as\n&gt; there are notes to the octave.  Each note of the scale has the ability to\n&gt; travel the distance of any one of those intervals.\n&gt;\n&gt; In a JI scale, there are many more intervals than notes in the scale.  Each\n&gt; note has a collection of different intervals it can move in either\n&gt; direction.  It is different among notes.\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re talking about a new kind of JI (new for me), one that isn&#39;t bound to\n&gt; a scale.  In this kind of system, there are infinite possible intervals, and\n&gt; each note is capable of traveling the distance of any interval you can think\n&gt; of.  Infinity!\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow!\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I know I&#39;m not ready for infinity, for a variety or reasons.  I think\n&gt; all composers need to set limits for themselves so they don&#39;t go crazy and\n&gt; can make sense of things.  To me, an equal temperament seems like a\n&gt; reasonable limit to set.  x number of intervals, x number of notes, each\n&gt; interval available to each note.  An interconnected but not infinite JI\n&gt; scale makes sense as a different kind of limit.  Lots of intervals,\n&gt; dispersed all over the place.  A limited number of notes and a limited\n&gt; collection of abilities given to each note.  These two kinds of scale\n&gt; satisfy different needs.  They create different limits.  They&#39;re wonderfully\n&gt; different.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again for your perspective, Kraig.  It got me thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt; --- kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Andrew and yes do enjoy your CD!\n&gt; &gt;      When i work in JI i am always aware of how i am plowing in a\n&gt; &gt; particular\n&gt; &gt; field where from each point it is possible to expand further. With Et i am\n&gt; &gt; in a\n&gt; &gt; closed cycle and there is no way to add anything to it. It is unable to\n&gt; &gt; grow. (\n&gt; &gt; of course one can always start dividing each temperment into smaller equal\n&gt; &gt; divisions).\n&gt; &gt;     Partch referred to his 43 tone scale. In actuality he had way more\n&gt; &gt; because\n&gt; &gt; on any of these degrees he could and would put whole harmonic and\n&gt; &gt; subharmonic\n&gt; &gt; hexads. The instruments themselves found their own natural way out of the\n&gt; &gt; system.\n&gt; &gt;     Even if one does not have a particular note for example, it is quite\n&gt; &gt; easy\n&gt; &gt; to ask any player to play a fifths a fourth or a Just third relations to\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; without too much trouble.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.

I find them all equally valid and interesting, but that&#39;s only\nafter listening to them for 3-4 times. Someone with access to the\ntuning information with an opportunity to explore the tunings in more\ndepth would make a more complete response to the differences. They are\njust too subtle for my ears to assess a mood or feeling. \n\nI would like to understand the differences though. To do that, I would\nrecommend a single piece that highlights the differences. In other\nwords, create a piece that makes the differences into musically\ninteresting material. Make it more obvious to the casual listener that\nthere is something going on here. \n\nIf one of the thirds, fifths, seconds is lower/higher than the other,\nmake a piece that showcases the difference between them, so even a\nclassically trained ear could hear it.\n\nJust an idea.\n\nPrent Rodgers\n\nP.S. if pressed, I prefer C, since it seems more complex during the\nfirst 3-4 seconds.

For example, major thirds, relatively concordant but\nunstable in this kind of style, range from a rounded 408 cents in\nPythagorean JI to 412 cents in 99-tET and 414 cents in HTT-29.\n\nAs it happens, 99-tET and HTT-29 also have available major thirds at\nor near 5:4 (~386.31 cents), as does Pythagorean if carried to enough\nnotes, for example a 53-note circulating tuning almost identical to\n53-tET. If such thirds were used as the norm in a piece in any of\nthese tunings, I suspect that the mood might be quite different than\nin my piece.\n\nThere would, as with my piece, be small differences between the\ntunings: pure 5:4 thirds in HTT-29; slightly narrow approximations of\nthis ratio in Pythagorean (~384 cents), and slightly wide\napproximations in 99-tET (~388 cents).\n\nYet the contrast between a 384-388 cent range and a 408-414 cent range\nmight affect the &quot;mood&quot; more than the small distinctions within each\nrange.\n\nNow for some comments which reflect this agenda and also suggest\nanother kind of example which, as mentioned above, I hope to post\nsoon.\n\nJacob:\n\n&gt; For the life of me I can&#39;t tell the difference between these three.\n&gt; Anyone else?\n\nChristopher:\n\n&gt; I also plead lack of any ear-ability whatsoever . . . . . .  I&#39;ve\n&gt; only tried it on Quick time, maybe my synth at home would do more?\n&gt; :(\n\nAaron:\n\n&gt; Yes, whatever difference is extremely subtle to me. I thought I\n&gt; might guess at the &#39;b&#39; example being a bit more towards just, but\n&gt; on relistening, I&#39;m not so sure......\n\n&gt; Margo, can you enlighten us ?\n\nPlease let me confirm, as discussed above, that &#39;b&#39; is indeed\nPythagorean JI. Your remarks, like those of Jacob and Cristopher,\nmight support the view that fifths tempered by up to at least around\n1.62 cents, as in HTT-29, can sound &quot;not so obviously different from\njust.&quot;\n\nAs you propose, my agenda was indeed an &quot;example of the blurryness\nsometimes between JI and the appropriate ET/temperament.&quot; Here 99-tET\nrepresents the ET side of the question, while HTT-29 in this\nseven-note diatonic context where only a single chain of fifths is\nused can represent a regular temperament other than an equal division\nof a 2:1 octave.\n\nPrent:\n\n&gt; I listened to the a-b-c MIDI comparison files referred to in your\n&gt; post. I find them all equally valid and interesting, but that&#39;s only\n&gt; after listening to them for 3-4 times. Someone with access to the\n&gt; tuning information with an opportunity to explore the tunings in\n&gt; more depth would make a more complete response to the differences.\n&gt; They are just too subtle for my ears to assess a mood or feeling.\n\nThank you for this response which not only fits what others have said,\nbut leads to your very interesting proposal that I would like to try\nhere soon.\n\n&gt; I would like to understand the differences though. To do that, I\n&gt; would recommend a single piece that highlights the differences. In\n&gt; other words, create a piece that makes the differences into\n&gt; musically interesting material. Make it more obvious to the casual\n&gt; listener that there is something going on here.\n\nActually, this gives me an idea for a piece that highlights the\ndifference between two tuning systems with often similar interval\nsizes, but in different arrangements, so that applying them to the\nsame piece might result in some notable contrast.\n\n&gt; If one of the thirds, fifths, seconds is lower/higher than the other,\n&gt; make a piece that showcases the difference between them, so even a\n&gt; classically trained ear could hear it.\n\n&gt; Just an idea.\n\nWith the three tunings in these examples, one way to carry out this\nidea might be to use what I might describe as augmented or diminished\nintervals with longer chains of fifths, where the sizes vary more than\nwith regular diatonic intervals -- and I&#39;d like to try this idea also.\n\n&gt; P.S. if pressed, I prefer C, since it seems more complex during the\n&gt; first 3-4 seconds. Less stark to my untrained ears.\n\nPlease let me respond to your composerly words: &quot;Would that my ears\nwere similarly `untrained.&#39;&quot; By the way, I&#39;m very interested in trying\nCSound for Linux, and look to your music as one outstanding source in\nthis process.\n\nGeorge might score this remark about a &quot;more complex&quot; quality as\nsupport for his approach in a tuning such as HTT-29: often temper\nintervals just a bit to make them &quot;less stark&quot; -- or subtly less\nsimple, at any rate.\n\nCarl (quoting Aaron&#39;s remark about `b&#39; as sounding nearer to just):\n\n&gt; I had the same thing happen to me. I rerelistened just now, and\n&gt; A and C sound exactly the same, but B smoother.\n\nIndeed for regular diatonic intervals like those used in my piece,\n99-tET and HTT-29 are very similar. For example, major thirds are\naround 412.12 cents and 414.13 cents respectively; and minor seconds\naround 84.85 and 82.11 cents.\n\nGene:\n\n&gt; I&#39;d propose a side-by-side of JI with atomic, but unfortunately this\n&gt; would require me to sharpen fifths and major thirds by 1/96 of an\n&gt; atom, which is approximately 1/38 of a mu. Brave souls who want to\n&gt; hear this difference could try 440 Hz vs 440.00004 Hz in\n&gt; Csound. After six hours and 50 minutes you&#39;ve gone through a\n&gt; beat. So is it JI, or still a temperament?\n\nWhile I&#39;m not acquainted with the &quot;atomic&quot; tuning system you discuss,\nthe overall effect (as with pure Pythagorean, likely much less\naccurate in practice than this &quot;tempered&quot; tuning, of course!) might\nillustrate my point about mood and style.\n\nIn the style of my piece, fifths would be virtually pure, and major\nthirds quite active -- here a minute quantity larger than a just 81:64\n(~407.82 cents).\n\nBy the way, as to 99-tET or HTT-29, I now realize that while my\nharpsichord timbre was intended to be &quot;bright&quot; (which can often\nhighlight certain distinctions), a more sustained timbre might better\nbring out small nuances in the tempering of fifths, for example.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

This tuning \ngives near-just 15-limit otonalities on each tone in a chain of \nfifths from Bb to A.  Some of the 15-limit consonances are exact \n(5/4, 7/4, 7/5, and 13/9), and 11/9 and 13/11 are so close (~0.05c) \nthat you&#39;ll never be able to hear that they&#39;re not exact.\n\nI hesitate to call a this a temperament, because it has *very* low \nerror at the 7-limit, which makes it extremely difficult to tell that \nit is, strictly speaking, a temperament.  To approximate the 15-limit \nconsonances in its 6 best keys with an ET more accurately, you have \nto go over 100 tones (to 130-ET).  If you want to try it in Scala, \nthen I strongly recommend reading the top part of the message for \nadvice on how to set the notation for this tuning.\n\nBetter yet, maybe I should make available an mp3 file of a recording \nof a live performance I gave in San Diego in 1975, an improvisation \non the Scalatron in 29-HTT.  Then you can all judge for yourselves \nwhether it sounds like JI or a temperament.  (I should add that it \nwasn&#39;t hard to come up with Scaltron timbres that are highly \neffective in revealing the subtle differences between tunings.)\n\n&gt; One point I wanted to make with these examples is that &quot;mood&quot; might\n&gt; reflect the style of a given piece at least as much as fine points\n&gt; about the structure of a given tuning system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here, for example, I composed in more or less of a 13th-century\n&gt; European kind of style using diatonic Pythagorean or near-\nPythagorean\n&gt; intervals. For example, major thirds, relatively concordant but\n&gt; unstable in this kind of style, range from a rounded 408 cents in\n&gt; Pythagorean JI to 412 cents in 99-tET and 414 cents in HTT-29.\n\nIn 29-HTT the thirds and sixths come much closer to simple ratios \nthan in the other tunings.  The major thirds are ~14/11 and the minor \nthirds are ~13/11.  The net result is that, paradoxically, these \nintervals are close to points of local maximum harmonic *dissonance*, \nwhich (in conjunction with their excellent melodic effect) makes them \nvery suitable for Margo&#39;s neo-medieval style of composition.  This is \nnot what I had in mind when I devised this tuning, but I&#39;m delighted \nthat it has worked so well for her and am grateful that I have been \nable to learn a thing or two about the relationships between melody \nand harmony from her music.\n\n&gt; Prent:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I listened to the a-b-c MIDI comparison files referred to in your\n&gt; &gt; post. I find them all equally valid and interesting, but that&#39;s \nonly\n&gt; &gt; after listening to them for 3-4 times. Someone with access to the\n&gt; &gt; tuning information with an opportunity to explore the tunings in\n&gt; &gt; more depth would make a more complete response to the differences.\n&gt; &gt; They are just too subtle for my ears to assess a mood or feeling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for this response which not only fits what others have \nsaid,\n&gt; but leads to your very interesting proposal that I would like to try\n&gt; here soon.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; P.S. if pressed, I prefer C, since it seems more complex during \nthe\n&gt; &gt; first 3-4 seconds. Less stark to my untrained ears.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; George might score this remark about a &quot;more complex&quot; quality as\n&gt; support for his approach in a tuning such as HTT-29: often temper\n&gt; intervals just a bit to make them &quot;less stark&quot; -- or subtly less\n&gt; simple, at any rate.\n\nYes, and it seems to me that I said something very recently about \ndeparting very slightly from exact mathematical relationships for \nartistic effect:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/6833\n\nBTW, hi Prent!  It&#39;s been quite a few years since we&#39;ve seen each \nother.  Good to see and hear that you&#39;re composing some very nice \nthings.  Keep on!\n\n&gt; ...\n&gt; By the way, as to 99-tET or HTT-29, I now realize that while my\n&gt; harpsichord timbre was intended to be &quot;bright&quot; (which can often\n&gt; highlight certain distinctions), a more sustained timbre might \nbetter\n&gt; bring out small nuances in the tempering of fifths, for example.\n\nThe problem with making tuning comparisons using sustained timbres on \nsynths is that the tone is almost always modulated in some way \n(vibrato, chorus effects, phase shifting, etc.).  While this makes 12-\nET more tolerable by covering up the rapid beating of the 3rds and \n6ths, it also makes it difficult to hear subtle differences between \ntunings.  I suggest trying the &quot;overdriven guitar&quot; patch on your \nsynth to get relatively straight tones that are still rich in \nharmonics, yet more sustained.  I&#39;ve already prepared some midi files \nusing this patch that clearly reveal subtle differences in a lot of \ndifferent tunings (JI, ETs, and middle-path), which I hope to make \navailable soon for all to hear.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

The most famous example is \nmeantone temperament, whose various varieties are solutions to the \nproblem of best tempering out the syntonic comma (81:80) without \nregard to any other commas vanishing. Schismic (or schismatic) \ntemperament is another classic example (q.v. Helmholtz, Groven, and \nSabat-Garibaldi), while recently we have seen the discovery and \nrediscovery of quite a few other such schemes, such as Miracle, \nHanson, and the &quot;Pajara&quot; system which forms the underpinning for my \npaper on the decatonic scales.\n\nLike JI and ETs, middle path tunings are &quot;regular&quot; -- a given \nconsonance is represented the same way no matter where it appears in \nthe tuning system. It seems to me that if a property such \nas &quot;regularity&quot; is possessed by both JI and the ETs, then it ought to \nbe possessed by any &quot;middle path&quot; between them.\n\nMy XH18 paper is a complete survey of 5- and 7-limit, two-dimensional \n(like those mentioned above) &quot;middle path&quot; systems within a certain \nboundary on error and complexity. In fact, the title of the paper is \n_The Middle Path. Part 1: Fifty Floragrams_.\n\nIt seems that you are now putting forth a different definition \nof &quot;middle path&quot;, similar to the &quot;well-temperament&quot; concept, which \nrefers to closed systems (while mine refers to open systems) and \nirregular systems (while mine refers to closed systems). I can \ncertainly see how a JI periodicity block might be created, then \ntempered first near the edges, and finally tempered uniformly \neverywhere to yield an ET, such that the middle step would be a well-\ntemperament. However, I feel this unfairly omits the whole universe \nof possibilities where fewer of the periodicity blocks&#39; unison \nvectors are tempered out, and which are thus also in the &quot;middle&quot; \nbetween JI and ETs.\n\nWhile I certainly respect your thinking process, and the musical \nvalue of well-tempered systems is unquestionable, I wonder if we&#39;re \nheading toward a terminological nightmare here.\n\nCheers,\nPaul\n\n\n"

Mystery\nsolved.  ;&lt;)\n\n&gt; No matter, it is a very nice piece, and very well\n&gt; \n&gt; produced. Frankly, it reminds me of some of the music I&#39;ve been listening \n&gt; to a *lot* lately, but I mean that in a very positive vein.\n\nI think he did a great job with it.  If my own concoction of the same\nmaterial comes out half that good, I&#39;ll be very proud.\n\n&gt; Not wanting to cross-pollinate threads, but you mentioned branching to JI \n&gt; at some point, and this track made me think about your work: it seems that\n&gt; \n&gt; you are a very melodically-focused player/composer, as opposed to working\n&gt; a \n&gt; lot on harmonic/chord progressions. In this respect, JI tunings may not (I\n&gt; \n&gt; emphasize *may*) jump out at you as being gigantically different.\n\nOh, they definitely do seem gigantically different to me in some ways, but\nI&#39;m finding that much of what I&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; through working with equal\ntemperaments holds meaning in a JI universe.  At any rate, I absolutely\nadore  exploring the differences as well as the similarities.\n\nPerhaps I am primarily melodically-focused.  I&#39;ve never considered it. \nYou&#39;ve given me something to reflect upon.  Thanks!\n\n&gt; It would also be a VERY swell thing if we can get you to tackle things not\n&gt; \n&gt; limited to 12 pitches. Seems like you are a better muso than that!\n\nThank you!  This summer, I intend to purchase X. J. Scott&#39;s Li&#39;l Miss&#39; Scale\nOven, which will allow me tune up anything I can dream up.  In a way, it\nmight be good that I&#39;ve been limited.  I imagine it&#39;s keeping me focused,\nand possibly preventing me from going insane.\n\nThanks for listening, and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the piece.\n\nBest,\nAndrew\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.

Beyond that, the individual tones \nare usually percieved as close to some ET tunings&#39; interval, or very \nxentoanlly &#39;out-of-tune&#39; that I think it&#39;s worthless to squabble about JI vs. \nanything else anymore.\n\nJust my take on things.\n\nAlso, don&#39;t forget that if you are looking for a boundary between JI and ET, \n19-tet kind of blurs that, in that it&#39;s pretty damn close to a chain of 19 \npure minor thirds. (I know that&#39;s not what most people mean by JI--they \nusually mean 5-limit duodene type stuff, or various 7-limit tunings, etc. \nwhere the interval numbers stay &#39;low&#39; (whatever that means I guess depends on \nwho you talk to))\n\nAnyway I&#39;m convinced that the boundaries become so fuzzy between JI and non-JI \nthat I think it&#39;s clearly a religious issue to draw a line in the sand, and \nwell, I don&#39;t think to fondly of religion ;)\n\nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n"

I&#39;m more comfortable in 19 now, have \nsequence, chord, and scale charts to point out the tonal stuff.  \nguess I should start doing that for 22 or 31.\n\n\n"

I heard a Good Humor ice-cream truck \napproach with a fantastically warped/broken sounding set of ice-cream chimes.\n\nI wish I had a sample of it to share with you. But it basically sounded \nmagical in it&#39;s severe out-of-tuneness. It sounded like we were all in an \nYves Tanguy painting, buying ice cream from some kind of Willa Wonka type \nperson. Or that gumby himself was going to serve us up some soft serve.\n\nIt made me think: I like things that sound like they are &#39;broken&#39;. Like that \nice cream trucks chimes. Like electronic circuits that are chaotically wired. \nLike the &#39;wrong note&#39; aesthetic of Prokofieff, Stravinsky, Honegger, Milhaud.\nI also imagined a sort of never before heard insect like music that had a \nmechanical clarity, but then the &#39;brokeness&#39; came from someone stepping on \nthat insect...\n\nBut I have to tell you, the ice cream truck beat &#39;em all. It&#39;s something I&#39;ll \nnever forget in my life. I swear it could inspire a whole movement in music \ntowards the sweetly macabre xentonal !!!!\n\nBest,\n-- \nAaron Krister Johnson\nhttp://www.dividebypi.com\nhttp://www.akjmusic.com\n\n"

It thoroughly knocked my socks off and I deeply enjoyed \nit.\n\nI believe it was around February 1980.\n\n&gt; If you have a recording of that concert, I think everyone here would\n&gt; really gain by listening to it. \n\nSorry, I don&#39;t.  However, one of the pieces that I did at that \nconcert was a not-completely-successful attempt to recreate a JI \nimprovisation that I put on tape a couple years earlier.  The \nrecording is 12.5 minutes in length, and I consider it the best thing \nI produced during the 1970s.  I&#39;ll make that available, in addition \nto the other improv in 29-HTT that I mentioned.\n\n&gt; If you need assistance in getting an\n&gt; MP3 of that online, let me know.\n\nI now have software to produce mp3 files, and I&#39;ve already done one \nfor the JI piece, although I think that I need to try redoing it with \na higher volume level (since I notice that the onset of distortion \ndoes not seem to occur gradually, as with analog recording, where I \nhave been accustomed to leaving some headroom).\n\nNow as far as finding a *place* to put those files goes, I haven&#39;t \ngiven that much thought, since I am already much too busy even to \nthink about maintaining a website.  I suppose I could use the files \nsection for this group if I left them there for no more than a couple \nof weeks.\n\n&lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; George/Prent,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll second Prent&#39;s entreaty - I&#39;ve often wondered what &quot;Secor \nMusic&quot; \n&gt; sounds like! \n\nVirtually everything I performed last century was either composed by \nsomeone else or an improvisation.  Only recently have I begun to do \nany actual composing in alternate tunings, and that has been only \nslow and sporadic (since I tend to be a perfectionist, and also \nbecause the Sagittal notation project has been taking up a lot of my \ndiscretionary time).  But I expect to be putting some things out in \nthe near future.\n\n&gt; I know Prent is in the upper left corner of the country, if \n&gt; you are closer to the lower left corner I&#39;d be happy to help with \nthe mp3 \n&gt; stuff as well (if you need).\n\nI left southern California in 1987 (too dry, too crowded, too noisy, \ncost of living too expensive, and weather too boring -- I missed the \nseasons) and am now back in middle America, where microtonalists are \nfewer and farther between, but relatives are much closer.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

However, one of the pieces that I did at that \n&gt;concert was a not-completely-successful attempt to recreate a JI \n&gt;improvisation that I put on tape a couple years earlier.  The \n&gt;recording is 12.5 minutes in length, and I consider it the best\n&gt;thing I produced during the 1970s.  I&#39;ll make that available, in\n&gt;addition to the other improv in 29-HTT that I mentioned.\n\nOh yes, &quot;bring it&quot;!  :)\n\n&gt;&gt; If you need assistance in getting an\n&gt;&gt; MP3 of that online, let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt;I now have software to produce mp3 files, and I&#39;ve already done\n&gt;one for the JI piece, although I think that I need to try redoing\n&gt;it with a higher volume level (since I notice that the onset of\n&gt;distortion does not seem to occur gradually, as with analog\n&gt;recording, where I have been accustomed to leaving some headroom).\n&gt;\n&gt;Now as far as finding a *place* to put those files goes, I\n&gt;haven&#39;t given that much thought, since I am already much too\n&gt;busy even to think about maintaining a website.  I suppose I\n&gt;could use the files section for this group if I left them\n&gt;there for no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nI&#39;m happy to host &#39;em, or try SoundClick.\n\n-Carl \n\n\n"

But (British microtonalists may laugh) a\n&gt; comedian by the name of Les Dawson was an expert at the comic qualities\n&gt; of wrong notes. Of course it goes without saying that wrong-note\n&gt; romanticism is exemplified by Berg and his violin concerto.\n\nI&#39;m interested!

I did retune one to 11-ET last night, and it sounded interesting (not\nbad, just weird).\n\nTry retuning the file to something non-12-equal. That&#39;s the only way I can\nwrite microtonal music right now, write it in 12-equal and retune it with\nScala.\n\n\n"

This tuning \n&gt; gives near-just 15-limit otonalities on each tone in a chain of \n&gt; fifths from Bb to A.  Some of the 15-limit consonances are exact \n&gt; (5/4, 7/4, 7/5, and 13/9), and 11/9 and 13/11 are so close (~0.05c) \n&gt; that you&#39;ll never be able to hear that they&#39;re not exact.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hesitate to call a this a temperament, because it has *very* low \n&gt; error at the 7-limit, which makes it extremely difficult to tell \nthat \n&gt; it is, strictly speaking, a temperament.  To approximate the 15-\nlimit \n&gt; consonances in its 6 best keys with an ET more accurately, you have \n&gt; to go over 100 tones (to 130-ET).  If you want to try it in Scala, \n&gt; then I strongly recommend reading the top part of the message for \n&gt; advice on how to set the notation for this tuning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Better yet, maybe I should make available an mp3 file of a \nrecording \n&gt; of a live performance I gave in San Diego in 1975, an improvisation \n&gt; on the Scalatron in 29-HTT.  Then you can all judge for yourselves \n&gt; whether it sounds like JI or a temperament.  (I should add that it \n&gt; wasn&#39;t hard to come up with Scaltron timbres that are highly \n&gt; effective in revealing the subtle differences between tunings.)\n\nHere&#39;s the file, as promised:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/secor/improv29.mp3\n\nI&#39;ll leave it there for only a few days, since there is not much \nspace.\n\nI had been working with the Scalatron only for a few months when I \ndid this, so I didn&#39;t have years of experience playing the \ngeneralized keyboard.  Also, I had devised the tuning only about 6 \nmonths before and was only beginning to figure out how to use its \nresources.  So this is not a polished performance by a seasoned \ncomposer -- just the best I could do at the time to present an \nexample of 15-limit harmony in a live performance on a polyphonic \nsynthesizer at a time when Ben Johnston was writing 5-limit JI and \nhardly anyone was performing live with a polyphonic synthesizer in 12-\nET.\n\nThe concert, sponsored by the Motorola Scalatron Company, was given \nin San Diego in November 1975 at the convention of the National \nAssociation of Schools of Music (NASM).  Half of it consisted of \npieces which I performed on the Scalatron, both solo and as \naccompanist for soprano Barbara Dalheim, who sang several pieces by \nBen Johnston (who was also present).  The other half was performed by \nthe Partch Ensemble, directed by Danlee Mitchell.  Need I say that \nnot a single piece was in 12-ET?\n\n--- In MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you need assistance in getting an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; MP3 of that online, let me know.\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt;Now as far as finding a *place* to put those files goes, I\n&gt; &gt;haven&#39;t given that much thought, since I am already much too\n&gt; &gt;busy even to think about maintaining a website.

I think that this file would be mostly of historical \ninterest, so if you want to put this on your website (with some of \nthe preceding paragraphs as program notes), you&#39;re welcome to do so.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

Also, I had devised the tuning only about 6 \n&gt;months before and was only beginning to figure out how to use its \n&gt;resources.  So this is not a polished performance by a seasoned \n&gt;composer -- just the best I could do at the time to present an \n&gt;example of 15-limit harmony in a live performance on a polyphonic \n&gt;synthesizer at a time when Ben Johnston was writing 5-limit JI and \n&gt;hardly anyone was performing live with a polyphonic synthesizer in\n&gt;12-ET.\n&gt;\n&gt;The concert, sponsored by the Motorola Scalatron Company, was given \n&gt;in San Diego in November 1975 at the convention of the National \n&gt;Association of Schools of Music (NASM).  Half of it consisted of \n&gt;pieces which I performed on the Scalatron, both solo and as \n&gt;accompanist for soprano Barbara Dalheim, who sang several pieces by \n&gt;Ben Johnston (who was also present).  The other half was performed\n&gt;by the Partch Ensemble, directed by Danlee Mitchell.  Need I say\n&gt;that not a single piece was in 12-ET?\n\nAwesome awesome awesome.  George, may I suggest you cross-post this\nto tuning?  Just give this url instead, so everyone can listen...\n\nhttp://lumma.org/tuning/secor/improv29.mp3\n\n-Carl\n\n\n"

(this \ndoes have application to the forum, but i have to tell the whole \nmethod)\n\nbasically, i take a large, complicated, wide spectrum noise, and \nuse a skinny band pass filter tunable to hz.  whereas before i \nwould have tuned chunks of noise, i want something which has \na bit of movement to it now.  And i don&#39;t want to use a vocoder, \nbecause i can widen the filter and even introduce another for a \nvariety of cool sliding effects/ harmonic events which turn quickly \nand controllably into nonharmonic events.\n\nso, basically, the application to this forum is that now i have to \nuse a calculator to figure out the ratios between my hz, and \nmusic theory has become way more complicated for me, now \njust dealing with ratios.  the rub is that it&#39;s actually easier now to \nfigure out the exact ratios then it would be to &quot;devise a \ntemperament.&quot;  I&#39;m not working with a tonic, per se, that i would \ngo back to, more of just a theme, and i don&#39;t really mind where in \nthe spectrum it ends up.\n\npretty wacky!\n\n\n"

There is one very interesting point \n&gt; towards the end (2:43-2:50) when you play a melody in clusters of \nvery \n&gt; small intervals.\n\nI&#39;ve deleted this from the original (temporary) link.  But, thanks to \nCarl Lumma, it is now at:\n\nhttp://lumma.org/tuning/secor/improv29.mp3\n\nI wasn&#39;t able to identify the passage from your description without \nusing the timer, since I didn&#39;t remember using any small-interval \nclusters anywhere.  I thought you might have been referring to the \npairs of tones a comma apart from 1:29-2:04, but I was pretty sure \nthat would have been too early.\n\nThe only interval anywhere around the time range you mentioned that I \nwould call &quot;non-just&quot; is the one at 2:42, where the lower note is a \n*wrong note* (drat!!!) -- you&#39;ll hear the intended interval, a 5:6, \ntwo dyads later.  The smallest intentional interval in this passage \nis a repeated 13:15 (~289 cents) at 2:46-2:48.  Except for the wrong-\nnote interval (~240 cents, or a little wider than 7:8), the entire \npassage from 2:36-3:00 is nothing more than noodling on a single \nharmonic series on F, with the two upper voices two harmonics apart \nin the range of 7 to 15, i.e., 7:9, 8:10, 9:11, ... 13:15 above a \ndrone fifth, 4:6 (F:C).\n\nAnyway, I agree that the wrong note definitely makes the passage much \nmore interesting -- the smaller wrong-note interval seems to \nanticipate the effect of the 13:15, which doesn&#39;t come across as a \nconsonance, at least in this context.\n\n&gt; Where these tuning puns, or were you going for non-just \n&gt; to show contrast.\n\nThere was a section (2:21-2:31) where I did intentionally use three \nsomewhat dissonant triads with 11:14 (~major) and 11:13 (~minor) \nthirds (intervals that Margo often uses diatonically) for contrast, \nwith the last 11:14 expanding into even more dissonant thirds, which \nshows that, like JI, this tuning can deliver a high consonance-\ndissonance contrast.  (BTW, I hope you haven&#39;t forgotten that I said \nthat this tuning is actually a *temperament* that I claimed would \nsound like JI.  From your last comment I have gotten the impression \nthat I succeeded.)\n\n&gt; Neat stuff regardless.\n\nThanks for the brief critique.  I will now be much less hesitant to \nintroduce notes that are foreign to the particular scale I&#39;m using \n(as a subset of the tuning) or that don&#39;t readily fit into my \ntheoretical paradigm.\n\n--George\n\nP.S. - Please don&#39;t get the impression that I&#39;m averse to using JI.  \nWhile I prefer temperaments for a 13 prime limit (the lowest limit I \ncare to use), I feel that JI really starts to shine at higher prime \nlimits, where I would say that it outclasses all temperaments.  There \nI find that I am inclined to take a somewhat different approach to \nhow I derive sets of JI tones and scale subsets.\n\n\n\n"

Such an open project might help to convey the\nrange of approaches to &quot;making micro music,&quot; not so surprising given\nthe variety of computing approaches as well as musical styles.\n\nAn open project might have the advantage not only of providing helpful\ninformation, but of collecting and communicating it in a way that\nserves to encourage participation and built community.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

One can use these best\napproximations in a neo-medieval kind of style while keeping to the\nsame familiar fingerings and note spellings as in Pythagorean tuning.\n\nTwo features of 22-tET have drawn mixed comments: the rather heavy\ntemperament of the fifth (about 7.14 cents wide), and the small size\nof the diatonic semitone at around 55 cents (1/22 octave). While I\ntend to prefer a milder tempering of the fifth (except when I&#39;m using\nsomething like 13-tET, 14-tET, 20-tET, or 25-tET, that is!), I find\nthis tuning a stimulating variation for medieval or neomedieval\nmusic. Part of the fun is playing routine progressions in routine\npatterns -- with a &quot;pleasantly different&quot; sound.\n\nAs has been discussed, 22-tET presents some complications when used\nfor diatonic major/minor styles of tonality based on just or\napproximate ratios of 2-3-5 or 2-3-5-7; as an admirer of the 4:5:6:7\napproximation in this and similar &quot;paultone&quot; temperaments, Paul Erlich\nphas creatively and ingeniously developed a decatonic style of melody\nand harmony in which the music at once fits the structure of these\ntunings and achieves patterns of tonality analogous to those of the\nmajor/minor system.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@...\n\n\n"

One advantage of having\ncomputer audio capability is the opportunity to enjoy and share\nfeedback on such efforts -- and this one, from remarks so far, sounds\nlike a real classic!\n\nIn the meantime, I might say that a variation on HTT-29 that I call\nHTT-24 -- an unofficial variation, I would emphasize -- is a very\nattractive tuning to me. As noted, while it&#39;s structurally and\nmathematically a temperament, lots of the ratios are either just\n(e.g. 7:4, an important one for my style); virtually just to a\ntolerance of around 0.05 cents (e.g. 11:9, 13:11), in comparison with\na typical synthesizer resolution of around a cent or more; or\notherwise within about 3.248 cents of just.\n\nI really want to hear that 15:13 in the improvisation, about 248\ncents. Often I tend to hear it as &quot;cool and charmingly different,&quot; but\nI can see how it could be notably dissonant if the context leads you\nto expect some other kind of third.\n\nAnd to think, George, that you were doing this in 1975!\n\nOne of the charms of HTT-29 and a variation like HTT-24 is the\ncombination of near-just intervals, regular chains of fifths, and some\nclever nuances of temperament adding a creative element of\n&quot;not-quite-regular&quot; structure.\n\nSome of the same qualities also apply to a more obvious &quot;temperament&quot;\nlike 17-WT, a more compact and less accurate system which nevertheless\noffers some similar types of isoharmonic sonorities.\n\nThus while the structures are obviously different, I would regard\nHTT-29 and 17-WT alike as representing an approach which permits more\nregular or &quot;quasi-regular&quot; features than a classic JI system\nrepresenting three or more primes, while at the same time providing a\ngreater variety of intervals and sonorities than would occur in an\nequal temperament of comparable size.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m much looking forward to hearing that improvisation,\nGeorge!\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo\n\n\n"

Such an open project might\n&gt; help to convey the\n&gt; range of approaches to &quot;making micro music,&quot; not so\n&gt; surprising given\n&gt; the variety of computing approaches as well as\n&gt; musical styles.\n&gt; \n&gt; An open project might have the advantage not only of\n&gt; providing helpful\n&gt; information, but of collecting and communicating it\n&gt; in a way that\n&gt; serves to encourage participation and built\n&gt; community.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most appreciatively,\n&gt; \n&gt; Margo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

I find it a very creative sample/synth \nunit, lots can be done with a fairly straightforward interface. This piece \nlies somewhere between a high-end sampler and a freebie like Helios.\n\nI&#39;m trying to get a couple different sample makers to get *real* tuning \nsupport. I&#39;m hoping that I can convince Rene at rgc:audio to add support to \nthe sfz+ SoundFont player. It can also import .wav files, and has very good \nsound quality. To really get a good representation you need multi-sample, \nmulti-layer support, and this certainly seems like a good, low-cost \nsolution if we can get him to add microtuning (as in their wonderful synth, \nz3ta+).\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

I find it a very creative \nsample/synth \n&gt; unit, lots can be done with a fairly straightforward interface. \nThis piece \n&gt; lies somewhere between a high-end sampler and a freebie like Helios.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to get a couple different sample makers to get *real* \ntuning \n&gt; support. I&#39;m hoping that I can convince Rene at rgc:audio to add \nsupport to \n&gt; the sfz+ SoundFont player. It can also import .wav files, and has \nvery good \n&gt; sound quality. To really get a good representation you need multi-\nsample, \n&gt; multi-layer support, and this certainly seems like a good, low-cost \n&gt; solution if we can get him to add microtuning (as in their \nwonderful synth, \n&gt; z3ta+).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jon\n\nDo you know if Gigastudio or Kontakt are retunable?  They&#39;re a little \nout of my price range at the moment, but one of them might be a \nfuture purchase.\n\n\n"

As a rule, these are realtime generation devices.\n\nHowever...\n\nAll the current generation of DAWs (digital audio workstations), like \nCubase, Sonar, etc., allow you to burn your tracks to audio. You would \nsimply set them up as VST/DXi plugins into a midi sequence, assign which \ntracks should output to those synths, and then render/export to audio.\n\nYou have a very particular and fairly unique way of creating your pieces. I \ndon&#39;t anticipate there will be many units out there that render in quite \nthe manner that you currently do, but maybe you can adapt your end of the \nprocess a bit to take advantage of these. You might also consider demoing \nsome of these to see if any of the *sounds* are good to your ears, and then \nyou could always sample sounds and create your own soundfont with a \nsoundfont editor.\n\nJust some thoughts on the work process...\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

I&#39;ve found some shortcuts so tuning a single instrument now \n&gt;takes about an hour.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t seem any better than creating an entire sample set for any \nsampler out there. One merely would take multiple samples and then adjust \npitch and save as new notes. But either method means not only a lot more \nwork, but no immediate feedback if you come up with a new tuning. Not good \nenough, I say, if one wants to explore. But if you settle on a particular \ntuning, nothing will get you as good a sound as custom crafting the sample \nset itself.\n\nI&#39;m really impressed with the sound *quality* of rgc:audio&#39;s sfz+ soundfont \nplayer. I hadn&#39;t given soundfonts a lot of credit, but this thing took a \nsingle wave file and did a pretty damn good job of transposing without too \nmuch artifacts. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t cajole a use of microtuning...\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

I&#39;m simply\npointing out there is interest in any exceptions.\n\n&gt; However...\n&gt; \n&gt; All the current generation of DAWs (digital audio workstations), like \n&gt; Cubase, Sonar, etc., allow you to burn your tracks to audio. You would \n&gt; simply set them up as VST/DXi plugins into a midi sequence, assign\nwhich \n&gt; tracks should output to those synths, and then render/export to audio.\n\nI&#39;d be interested if anyone has anything to report on using this\nmethod to create microtonal music.\n\n&gt; You have a very particular and fairly unique way of creating your\npieces. \n\nSurely I can&#39;t be the only one currently employing the Scala to midi\nto rendered wav file method.

You might also consider\ndemoing \n&gt; some of these to see if any of the *sounds* are good to your ears,\nand then \n&gt; you could always sample sounds and create your own soundfont with a \n&gt; soundfont editor.\n\nThat&#39;s a thought. What I&#39;d really like to do is get a library of\nCsound instruments which I like. There&#39;s a huge amount of work on\nCsound, but it seems the emphasis is on making strange and exotic\nsounds. I&#39;m not interested in exotic; I want musicality. There is a\nbook out on Csound recipes for woodwinds, but I have never heard the\nresults and don&#39;t know if it would be worth it. I don&#39;t think much of\nthe waveguide instruments built into Csound, nor of FM synthesis, and\nadditive synthesis of sine waves is OK, but limited. Maybe I&#39;m just\ncranky.\n\n\n\n"

I&#39;m simply pointing \n&gt;out there is interest in any exceptions.\n\nI see (sorry about the &#39;confusion&#39; - it isn&#39;t rare that people get things a \nbit mixed in a new environment). There *may* be exceptions, which we should \nbe on the lookout for. But virtually all the development in these soft \ninstruments cater to people who make music either in realtime or in a \nsequencing environment. Stand-alone rendering engines are not going to pop \nup often.\n\n&gt;I&#39;d be interested if anyone has anything to report on using this method to \n&gt;create microtonal music.\n\nIt is pretty much all I&#39;ve used for the last year or so. If all you are \ndoing is ending up with a midi file out of Scala, you could do this with \nall the big/common DAWs. And, if you are doing as has been done so much - \nhaving Scala spit a single musical line onto multiple midi channels and \nusing pitch bend to create a tuning - you will *have* to render/export, \nbecause with multiple instances of a softsynth/sampler you&#39;ll quickly tax \nthe cpu. For similar reasons Csound is not (essentially) a realtime \nenvironment.\n\n&gt;Surely I can&#39;t be the only one currently employing the Scala to midi to \n&gt;rendered wav file method. I know a number of us are now using Scala, since \n&gt;I&#39;ve looked at some of the midi files people provide.\n\nI think most everyone else is a little more hands on in the creating of the \nsequence itself, before passing it to Scala. And an awful lot of these seem \nto end up simply as GM midi files (like Herman Miller&#39;s). It&#39;s only an \nopinion, but I find this method very unfulfilling, and not a good \nrepresentation of the music that should be there.\n\n&gt;There&#39;s a huge amount of work on Csound, but it seems the emphasis is on \n&gt;making strange and exotic sounds. I&#39;m not interested in exotic; I want \n&gt;musicality.\n\nThey aren&#39;t mutually exclusive, but I don&#39;t think you meant it that way \nanyhow. But the musicality of the end sound source is only part of the \nissue, because I&#39;ve heard people make the best, most well-crafted samples \nsound like a Speak-and-Spell toy. The musicality comes before the rendering \nas well.\n\n&gt;Maybe I&#39;m just cranky.\n\nIf you say so, but you are demanding as well, and there is nothing wrong \nwith that when you are applying it to your music! The demands I place on my \nown work is similar to what George Secor recently remarked: I have a hard \ntime being satisfied with my results, and end up fussing and tweaking, over \nand over.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

You wouldn&#39;t think it would be such a big deal to add tuning \n&gt;support to a soft synth, especially a higher end one like Kontakt.  I \n&gt;guess not enough people ask them for it.\n\nI know you are a pretty recent member, but one of the things that has been \nnice to see is that a few of the members of MMM, by working closely with \ndevelopers, have actually been catalysts for tuning to be an added feature. \nIt is very much the case that you just don&#39;t simply ask for the tuning \nsupport, but you show them why it is important, point to music that uses \nthese features, give them background on file formats, etc. You help them \nwork it out a bit, and likelihood of inclusion goes up.\n\nIt also seems that this is a bottom-up situation, as the small developers \nseem both more approachable and more interested in a niche feature like \nmicrotuning support. The big boys have no interest, they just want to move \nunits, and they&#39;ll include the feature set that appeals to the most common \naudience.\n\nThe weird thing is a company like NI: FM7 supports microtuning, Absynth has \na few presets and a promised internal tuning editor (hell, just import one \nof the file formats!), Kontakt or Kompakt supposedly has *some* internal \ntuning feature, and the other fine instruments have none at all. No \ncompany-wide vision on this aspect.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

And it didn&#39;t take long for me to find that \nI wouldn&#39;t have any use for the instrument itself, even if it was tuneable. \nThat is simply my taste, not necessarily anyone else&#39;s. On the other hand, \nthere is a softsynth from a small developer that I like Very Much, and I&#39;m \ngoing to approach him privately to see if he could add tuning to it.\n\n(Phi, could you email me off list regarding the code resources you&#39;ve come \nup with, as this is a SynthEdit instrument and he might be able to add it \neasily)\n\nSo, I&#39;ve gone through pretty much all the soft instruments that offer \nmicrotuning, and only some of them match up with the sounds I want to hear. \nNaturally, there are a couple that don&#39;t tune but I&#39;d love them too!\n\nBottom line: it isn&#39;t just the tuning that makes the music, and everyone \nneeds to evaluate the musicality, the nuances, the programming interface, \nand many other aspects of an instrument. It can certainly be figured out if \nyou are going to like an instrument even from a 12tet version.\n\nAt least I *think* so.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

CronoX uses the .tun \nformat, which you can make with Scala and have a universe of tunings. In \nthe .pdf manual that comes with CronoX there is an addendum chapter by \nJacky Ligon on how to do all this; loading a file is a simple 2 or 3 click \nprocess.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

Pick a file and \nthe instrument is tuned.\n\n(This is in demo version 1.302)\n\nIt is a nice instrument, but almost all the patches they send with it are \nvery spacey, ambient, trance-type patches. This is not a bad thing at all, \nand the instrument sounds very nice. But most of the patches wouldn&#39;t \nreally matter all that much if you used a particular tuning, because they \nalready contain so much pitch information in them already!\n\nHowever, it is another synth that looks pretty deep, and if someone wanted \nto spend some time crafting patches that really shine in other tunings, it \nmight be just the ticket. I can&#39;t remember how many presets it ships with, \nbut there are probably useable ones in there.\n\nAnother micro-tuneable demo that anyone can try (my version is PC, can&#39;t \nremember if they support Mac OS)...\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

LinPlug has a good track record of \n&gt; &gt; making good, microtunable VSTis and CronoX is no exception.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.linplug.com/Products/CronoX/cronox.htm\n&gt; &gt; Paolo\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I&#39;m going to try that.  There&#39;s a demo.  I didn&#39;t get home\n&gt; in time last night to install it and try, but it looks like what I\n&gt; want, a simple sampler with tuning support, and the price\n&gt; looks right.\n\nSome suggestions:\nTake a look at their KVR forum where you&#39;ll find useful topics:\n&lt;http://www.kvr-vst.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&gt;\nAnd this site in general for the news, the Bank/Patches section...\nYou have to register to login but it&#39;s free, and no spam!\nJust for info, I recommand the optional CronoX  &#39;Soundsets&#39;.\n\n&gt; I would like to have a program that works like a tracker (like \n&gt; Impulse Tracker or Buzz or Fast Tracker) that can load scales\n&gt; as well as allow for different notations and not simply remap\n&gt; the 12 notes.\n\nWith CronoX (like Albino and the new Alpha), just click the\nLinPlug logo or the logoname of the synth: you get the rear\npannel where you load any tun file format.\nHowever, this dialog allows to load any kind of text file.\nIn theory, no risk to crash the host application but we never know.\nSo, take care to load .tun files only.\nYou can run so many instances that you need, each one with a\ndifferent tuning, and the ability to load any other scale at any time\nwithout closing the synth nor quitting the host application.\n\nAbout this format, you can create your own scales with Scala on\nWindows and &#39;Max Magic Microtuner&#39; on Mac:\n&lt;http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/16tone/&gt;\n\nA very useful &quot;Tutorial for creating TUN files with Scala&quot;\nwritten by Jacky Ligon:\n&lt;http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/Scala_TUN_Tutorial.pdf&gt;\n\nCheers,\nPhi\n\n\n"

I wasn&#39;t hip to tracker technology, which is basically a \npattern-edit based sequencer made to use with soundcards, including \nbuilt-in sounds. Right?\n\nAny of the VST instruments that have been discussed here can be used in \ntraditional MIDI-based pattern sequencer. The one that comes to mind most \nfrequently is Fruity Loops. But there isn&#39;t ANY sequencer that I know of \n(unless there are some open source ones out there, really hidden...) that \nhas flexible enough notation for non12. And as for trackers, they seem \npointed at a user base that isn&#39;t going to be going beyond the bounds of \n12, and you&#39;d have to find someone that would be interested in that kind of \nfunctionality.\n\nMan, I&#39;d love to help, but I hope you realize you&#39;ve got a few issues \nhappening at once: you want non12 (we can do), you&#39;d like notation (ummm, \nmaybe in a couple of ways), and you want a tracker-style interface (if you \ngo the step-sequence route, there are lots out there that can do it along \nwith soft instruments). But putting that all together in one package may be \na difficult deal.\n\nThere are a few environments floating around out there that you can patch \nobjects together to create a lot of what you want (Bidule - \nhttp://www.plogue.com/ or energyXT - http://www.xt-hq.com/ - or maybe the \nVAZ modular system would do what you want - [have to Google it...]).

Such an open project might help to convey the\n&gt; range of approaches to &quot;making micro music,&quot; not so surprising given\n&gt; the variety of computing approaches as well as musical styles.\n&gt;\n&gt; An open project might have the advantage not only of providing helpful\n&gt; information, but of collecting and communicating it in a way that\n&gt; serves to encourage participation and built community.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most appreciatively,\n&gt;\n&gt; Margo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; More MMM music files are at http://www.microtonal.org/music.html\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]\n&gt; Yahoo!

I understand now.\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a such built-in software... :-(\nDoable with Max/MSP from Cycling 74\n(based on lcd drawings for pitch monitoring):\n&lt;http://www.cycling74.com/&gt;\n\nHTH,\nPhilippe\n\n\n"

Tertiaseptal[31] is low on tetrads, but\nTertiaseptal[47] has plenty, and Hemififths[41] does also, but does\nvery well for the 9-limit as well.\n\nThis discussion is interesting because Paul has been claiming that\nthere is not much interest in these temperaments in the 99-171 et\nrange, so I am gratified to hear that other people find something of\nvalue in errors under 1.5 cents.\n\n  72-ET \n&gt; clearly sounds like a low-error temperament, while 29-HTT sounds like \n&gt; JI without phase-locking, very similar to 130-ET. \n\nWhat I described here recently as &quot;JI with a sparkle&quot;. I agree; I\nthink there is something attractive about the tuning in the area of\n99, 118, 130, and 140. When we get up to 171, whatever it is starts to\ngo away and we get a sound more like true JI.\n\n Beating that \n&gt; occurs with approximated 7-limit consonances is much more noticeable \n&gt; than at higher limits, so you had better cut your allowable error in \n&gt; half at the 7 limit.\n\nOr use something like TOP error. I find TOP error together with Graham\ncomplexity useful in evaluating temperaments from the point of view of\nmy own notions of usefulness.\n\n&gt; Gene, for your enlightenment: 29-HTT consists (except for one filler \n&gt; tone) of 3 chains of fifths of ~703.5787c, or exactly (504/13)^\n&gt; (1/9).  The 3 chains of fifths contain tones 1/1, 5/4, and 7/4, \n&gt; respectively, and the tones in each chain are taken to as many places \n&gt; as are required to result in otonal ogdoads on roots Bb, F, C, G, D, \n&gt; and A.  This also gives very-near-just diatonic (5-limit) scales in 5 \n&gt; different keys.\n\nThanks, I&#39;ll look at this, though the results if any will probably go\nup on tuning-math.\n\n\n\n"

The score is also there, at the bottom.  The only \nsignificant difference between the 72-ET and Miracle (Stud-loco) \nexamples is in how the two ratios of 13 are approximated.\n\nPaul, you may be interested to compare 22-ET with 152-ET (linear \ntemperament using wide fifths).  I was surprised to find that the \nlatter sounds noticeably better (at least to me), even though the \nfifths have a greater error.\n\n&gt; &gt; Beating that \n&gt; &gt; occurs with approximated 7-limit consonances is much more \nnoticeable \n&gt; &gt; than at higher limits, so you had better cut your allowable error \nin \n&gt; &gt; half at the 7 limit.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean but if you mean that a \n&gt; given &#39;error&#39; is less noticeable for more complex ratios and more \n&gt; noticeable for simpler ratios, \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; this seems to support the &#39;TOP&#39; idea \n&gt; for tuning temperaments over the straight minimax-within-an-odd-\nlimit \n&gt; you seem to have advocated in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gene, for your enlightenment: 29-HTT consists (except for one \nfiller \n&gt; &gt; tone) of 3 chains of fifths of ~703.5787c, or exactly (504/13)^\n&gt; &gt; (1/9).  The 3 chains of fifths contain tones 1/1, 5/4, and 7/4, \n&gt; &gt; respectively, and the tones in each chain are taken to as many \nplaces \n&gt; &gt; as are required to result in otonal ogdoads on roots Bb, F, C, G, \nD, \n&gt; &gt; and A.  This also gives very-near-just diatonic (5-limit) scales \nin 5 \n&gt; &gt; different keys.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The greatest advantage:  the total number of tones/octave is \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; enough to make acoustic instruments practical (the smallest \nintervals \n&gt; &gt; being ~24 cents).\n&gt; \n&gt; I suggest that further analysis, and discussion of the details, of \n&gt; this temperament (and of temperament tuning schemes in general) \noccur \n&gt; on the tuning or tuning-math lists, in light of what we all know \n&gt; about this list.\n\nOkay, if anyone want to continue, then please take this to the main \nlist.\n\n--George\n\n\n\n"

One \ncan get good results with the GPO, as I&#39;ve worked with a number of film \ncomposers that use it. As with all sample-based stuff, you don&#39;t get good \nresults by just throwing something at it, you have to nuance the lines and \nall that good stuff...\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n\n"

But as you\nhear one can get use to the p.c.\nkeyboard eccentricities for triads and improvise\non it. It seems that a p.c. keyboard can\nusually play all diads which is useful.\n\nIf anyone happens to know the\nreason for this btw then I&#39;m\ninterested to know. It is operating\nsystem independent at least\nhappens in same way on same computer\nwith same keyboard if you use\nLinux, Windows 3.1, MSDOS or Windows 98\nso I&#39;m guessing that it doesn&#39;t depend on\nthe operating system at all.\n\nWhen you play the disallowed\ncombinations of keys on the p.c. keyboard,\nyou get a click or a beep from\nthe computer, seems to be\nfrom the modem on this machine,\nfor some reason, though not sure\nof that.\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They bill this as an &quot;Ethnic Melodic Virtual \nInstrument&quot;; from their site -http://www.DashSignature.com - is the following:\n\n&quot;EMM Knagalis is a specialized and multi featured VSTi sample player, \nmodeled around the structural elements of Sitar, the famous Indian lute . \nBut its sound set also includes many other ethnic stringed instruments, as \nwell as percussive and melodic instruments from the world stage. \nInstruments like Turkish Lute, Mbira (thumb piano), Santur, Shamishen.\n\nThere is even a bagpipe, a wind instrument, an instrument for which EMM \nKnagalis is ideal, with its legato playing style and drone accompaniment. \nEMM Knagalis brings these instruments to life.\n\nThe EMM Knagalis structure includes three sample layers:\n\nLead sound (monophonic)\nSympathetic emulation sound (polyphonic)\nDrone sound (monophonic)&quot;\n\nIt is actually fun to play, and they support importing of scales, but.....\n\nAargh! The instrument is limited to twelve steps per octave! And to make \nthe co-dependency complete, the have a utility to translate Scala files \ninto their own format, apparently allowing you to pick which twelve notes \nyou want. Yikes. But their instruments are pretty unique, and I&#39;m going to \nfollow up with them and see if there is any leeway in future design. It \nalso doesn&#39;t look like it supports sample importing, but sometimes (like \ntonight) it is good to work with challenges.\n\nFor now, I sat on a sandy river bank, strumming my virtual oud:\n\nSandspice - http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/sandspice.mp3  [2.4mb]\n\nI confess I mixed with headphones, which is pretty much a no-no, but I did \nso because some of the environmental sounds are binaural recordings; that \nsaid, it might be fun to listen with cans...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Szanto wrote:\n&gt; Hey list,\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally finding time, mostly by stopping downloading and trying each and\n&gt; every promising VST, etc. Trying to get a handle on my system and teaching\n&gt; myself how to make all the pieces work together, so I thought I might as\n&gt; well make some little mini-project-piecelets. I&#39;ve thought a lot about\n&gt; Prent Rodgers &quot;10 minutes a day&quot; routine, and while it will probably be\n&gt; more minutes but not on every day, I still like the drift.\n&gt;\n&gt; The little piece I did tonight is a combination of found sound and two\n&gt; tracks with an interesting instrument from Dash Signature called (clunky\n&gt; name): EMM-Knagalis. They bill this as an &quot;Ethnic Melodic Virtual\n&gt; Instrument&quot;; from their site -http://www.DashSignature.com - is the\n&gt; following:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;EMM Knagalis is a specialized and multi featured VSTi sample player,\n&gt; modeled around the structural elements of Sitar, the famous Indian lute .\n&gt; But its sound set also includes many other ethnic stringed instruments, as\n&gt; well as percussive and melodic instruments from the world stage.\n&gt; Instruments like Turkish Lute, Mbira (thumb piano), Santur, Shamishen.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is even a bagpipe, a wind instrument, an instrument for which EMM\n&gt; Knagalis is ideal, with its legato playing style and drone accompaniment.\n&gt; EMM Knagalis brings these instruments to life.\n&gt;\n&gt; The EMM Knagalis structure includes three sample layers:\n&gt;\n&gt; Lead sound (monophonic)\n&gt; Sympathetic emulation sound (polyphonic)\n&gt; Drone sound (monophonic)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It is actually fun to play, and they support importing of scales, but.....\n&gt;\n&gt; Aargh! The instrument is limited to twelve steps per octave! And to make\n&gt; the co-dependency complete, the have a utility to translate Scala files\n&gt; into their own format, apparently allowing you to pick which twelve notes\n&gt; you want. Yikes. But their instruments are pretty unique, and I&#39;m going to\n&gt; follow up with them and see if there is any leeway in future design. It\n&gt; also doesn&#39;t look like it supports sample importing, but sometimes (like\n&gt; tonight) it is good to work with challenges.\n&gt;\n&gt; For now, I sat on a sandy river bank, strumming my virtual oud:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sandspice - http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/sandspice.mp3  [2.4mb]\n&gt;\n&gt; I confess I mixed with headphones, which is pretty much a no-no, but I did\n&gt; so because some of the environmental sounds are binaural recordings; that\n&gt; said, it might be fun to listen with cans...\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; More MMM music files are at http://www.microtonal.org/music.html\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]\n&gt; Yahoo!

This piece is just a jump-start to writing...\n\nGrouping replies together, he types:\n\nTo Kraig - thanks, you know I value your ear. As for the fact that it could \ngo on, if it were real music it might. And change along the way. But that \nwill come later.\n\nTo Dante - yeah, that little box is pretty interesting. It goes a bit \nfarther than a standard sample-widget, and I give them high marks for \ningenuity in designing a product that really attempts to do One Thing Well. \nI hope to do a little piece-let with one of the bagpipes.\n\nTo Robt - thanks for liking the setting as well! I&#39;ve gotten to a point in \nmy life where plain old music (at least when it comes from my \npen/mind/fingers) doesn&#39;t interest me as much as little audio stories. I&#39;ll \ntry not to over-do the style, but I look around at the world and realize \nthat all the sounds fascinate me, not just musical sounds. I&#39;d like them to \nlive together in small versions/visions.\n\nTo Aaron - you wrote: &quot;I was hungry for this to be an alap, so that we \ncould eventually have a tabla enter and groove with it.... The scale was \ndelicious, as was the sample, which didn&#39;t tire my ears out.&quot; Funny, after \nI did it I *almost* went back and added some percussion, but I&#39;m trying to \navoid that - not dogmatically, but... - if only because percussion is the \nthing I most expect I can do, and I won&#39;t grow if I don&#39;t attempt other \nthings. See the Carl note on scale/alap...\n\nTo Kalle - you mentioned some Hindustani music (yes, I&#39;ve seen quite a few \npeople using those &quot;sruti boxes&quot;!) I wonder if it wouldn&#39;t make sense to \nhave one that is solar powered (maybe not in Scandinavia, but...).\n\nTo Carl - thanks for the ears. The scale? Damn, I wish I could tell you! I \njust turned on the music computer, but for some reason this synth doesn&#39;t \nshow up automatically in a saved project - you have to reload it (might be \na fluke of the timed demo). And I was trying different scales, and don&#39;t \nknow if it was the scale that was programmed with the patch or another - sorry.\n\nYou mentioned: &quot;My only complaint is too much reverb on the oud, and \nperhaps also on the whole mix.&quot; I agree, and some of that came as an \nanomoly of headphone mixing. Trying to set the instruments in a virtual \nspace without listening &#39;in the room&#39; hosed that one. I almost fixed it, \nbut I Cheneyed the thing and shut off the box...\n\n*****\n\nAgain, I appreciate the downloading and ear squinting. I&#39;ll keep working to \nput to rest the idea that Jon is all talk and no music...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Sure, oud players \ndepart from this a bit and use a lot of pitch *expression*, but the \nbasic vibe of the tuning sounded just right. Maybe not the \nscales/patterns chosen, but the tuning, yes.\n\n&gt; All of which leads me to suggest that Jon take a stab at my \nquestions \n&gt; about what he&#39;s looking for in a tuning, and then try one of them \nout.\n&gt; If nothing suggests itself, just go with 19 or 22 equal, or maybe \n&gt; Blackjack.\n\nYou&#39;re suggesting one of these for the oud example??

What I find more frustrating is a company that \nhas a completely schizophrenic approach to an issue like tuning: they have \ninstruments that go all the way from importing .tun files to instruments \nthat are locked in 12tet, with variations in between. Wildly inconsistent.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n"

You had so many notes of 22 tuned up that each step was \n&gt;the same, but Blackjack is too many??\n\nI&#39;m probably not being clear.\n\nWhen I&#39;ve tried to work with 22, I would simply load a Scala-generated 22 \nscale with 22 notes. I would work with it, looking (i.e. &quot;listening&quot;) to \nscales, and also trying to find harmonic resources as well. I didn&#39;t LIKE \nto have that many notes spread out in front of me, no sir. But I did want \nto access the full resources that 22 divisions of an octave would give me.\n\nAm I not correct that Blackjack uses _more_ than 22 notes? I really think \nthat anything getting to around 2 octaves or so *without* a repeating \nsymmetry in some fashion (like maybe 18 or 24, or less notes per octave) \nreally isn&#39;t something I&#39;m going to try and just _play_, but rather _study_ \nand then get going. And if I&#39;m going to have to _study_ something and \ncompose in the old fashioned way, I&#39;m probably going to put in a nice JI \nfabric of some sort. Cause I&#39;m built that way, I suppose. :)\n\nBTW, as to the comments on my &#39;oud playing&#39;, both you and Carl were _very_ \nclear in your comments, and I really blushed. I simply wanted to reiterate \nthat I would *never* try to pass that stuff off as either real oud playing \nor even anything more than an imitation; I simply let my fingers do what my \near or responses told them.\n\nKind of like &quot;I&#39;m not a doctor, but I play one on TV&quot;. :)\n\nI did, and do, take your compliments to heart, and glad that it pleased you \non some level.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;[MMM info]------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;More MMM music files are at http://www.microtonal.org/music.html\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]\n&gt;Yahoo!

That&#39;s why I&#39;ve come up with some scales that select from \nthem . . . well, I guess my point of view is this. If you&#39;ve ever \ntried to tune a piano, with no prior experience, by ear, so that it \nsounds good in every key, you&#39;ll know that this is really difficult \nto do by just tuning intervals that sound right, without relying on a \nprepared plan based on (someone) having done a careful consideration \nof interval relationships beforehand. Now, I&#39;m not too concerned with \nplaying in every key, but even the diatonic scale contends with these \nintricacies a little bit. If you&#39;re going to have chord progressions.\n\nIf you&#39;re not going to have chord progressions, well, Dave and I have \nsome other 22-scales for you . . .\n\n&gt; What is wrong with me? Have I totally misremembered? I am confusing \n&gt; Blackjack and Miracle, right?

Well, \nthe usual numbers for Meantone are 5, 7, 12, 19, 31 . . . and for \nMiracle, 21, 31, 41, 72 . . . In a sense, yes, Blackjack is a scale \n*within* Miracle tuning.\n\n&gt; And, with all these question marks, does it seem like you are \n&gt; talking to Joseph Pehrson?
