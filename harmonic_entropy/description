An offshoot of the Tuning Group, this group is focused on the mathematical modeling of musical consonance; specifically, the component of consonance that is not due to the critical-band roughness discussed by Plomp and Sethares, but an additional component related to the salience of the perception of a chord as a segment of a harmonic series -- as Parncutt discussed.
