Been away for awhile, so I'll first print all of Paul Erlich's post that

        After re-reading my post after Paul's comment, I can answer his
question "how far you'd go in defending the phrase 'regardless of how you
tune it'" quite easily: not far at all.  I have to admit that it came off
sounding like I don't believe that tuning "matters" at all, and this is
certainly not true.  My position would have been better served if I would
have approached it from this angle: once you choose a tuning -- ANY tuning
-- what then?  You're in a new universe -- are the "rules" the same here
or are they different?  What does "counterpoint" mean here?  How do you
want to define a "chord" and what does this definition imply about
voice-leading?  What's "consonant"? "dissonant"? "tonal"? "atonal"?  Does
this universe offer more "degrees of compositional freedom" or less?  Are
there formations, structures, transformations here that can't be found
elsewhere, and, if so, how can you take advantage of them?  Etc. etc.  In
7-scale diatonic (the language of the "Western canon"), these are all
non-questions unless you want to sound like Bach or Bacharach, and I sense
(with the possible exception of those legitimately interested in
historical tunings) most on the list are headed in clearly different
directions.

        What I'm trying to get across (and this is a follow up to my "why
triads?" question) might best be seen through an example.  So let me use
Paul's 10-scale (specifically, the non-ME "standard pentachordal major,"
SPM).  The reason for this choice as an example is that Paul has offered
one of the best attempts I've seen to confront _publicly_ many of the
above questions in a decatonic environment.  And as Paul and a few others
seem to have concluded, triads are not _necessarily_ the best or most
logical choice for basic sonorities in synthetic mega-scales for a number
of good reasons.

        While I will be pointing out what might be termed some
"difficulties" with Paul's SPM, the analysis to follow is NOT meant to
"dis" this scale which has many interesting properties pointed out in
Paul's article.  Looking on scale theory as a kind of "abstract geometry"
compels me to hold that, first, no scale (like no geometry) is "wrong,"
though it might be (compositionally) misused or misapplied, and second,
scales (like geometries) can be related to one another via their invariant
properties. This is not to say that the non-invariants of a given
scale/tuning are unimportant (which is what my previous post may have
implied); to the contrary, non-invariants give a specific scale its
characteristic "flavor."  Thus, among 7-scales, the usual vanilla diatonic
major and the paprika Hungarian minor share some important invariant
properties, but no one is likely to confuse their non-invariant
properties.

        The SPM is based on the interval string <2232223222>.  While it is
not maximally even, it is nevertheless symmetric, an important defining
quality in chord formation.  So the SPM is: (0,2,4,7,9,11,13,16,18,20). To
define/generate tetrachords, Paul uses the string <3322> -- again,
symmetric but not ME -- which is to say that we are to form a chord by
taking (generic) notes 1,4,7,9.  The result is the following set of 10
basic tetrachords (to the left of the vertical line):

        scale
        step    tetra      string quality       tetra    name

        I     0  7 13 18   <7654> Maj       |  0 3 6 8   0x
        II    2  9 16 20   <7744> Aug       |  1 4 7 9   1x
        III   4 11 18  0   <7744> Aug       |  2 5 8 0   2x
        IV    7 13 20  2   <6745> Min       |  3 6 9 1   3x
        V     9 16  0  4   <7645> Ma-mi     |  4 7 0 2   4x
        VI   11 18  2  7   <7654> Maj       |  5 8 1 3   5x
        VII  13 20  4  9   <7654> Maj       |  6 9 2 4   6x
        VIII 16  0  7 11   <6745> Min       |  7 0 3 5   7x
        IX   18  2  9 13   <6745> Min       |  8 1 4 6   8x
        X    20  4 11 16   <6754> Mi-ma     |  9 2 5 7   9x

        Now let's "reduce" the SPM to a chromatic 10-scale (call it 10X
for reference) whose string is <1111111111> (this is pretty much the same
as naming the diatonic scale steps):

        0  2  4  7  9 11 13 16 18 20
        |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
        V  V  V  V  V  V  V  V  V  V
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

        Using the same chord-defining string as before, <3322>, we can
generate 10 chords in 10X, each of which corresponds 1-to-1 to a chord in
SPM (see above to the right of the vertical line -- each 10X chord is
"named" for reference.)  Since each 10X chord is based on the same string,
<3322>, there is no way (other than relative scale position) to
distinguish and group them as there is with the chords in SPM.  Thus there
is no invariance between these two "systems" WITH RESPECT TO chord
"quality" -- and thus, since SPM and 10X are two ways to partition the
octave (two distinct tunings), tuning matters for specific chord quality
(but matters less, as we shall see, for _patterns_ of chord qualities).

        Now, Paul gives some very logical functional names to SPM chords
based on the identification of Q (3:2) with 13 chromatic steps.  We will
isolate here what he identifies as the tonic (I), the subdominant (V), and
the dominant (VII).  It's at this point that we can begin to see some very
important differences between 10-scales and 7-scales.  First, unlike
7-scales with <223> chords, 10-scales with <3322> chords only have one
triple of chords that covers the scale.  In the SPM scale, a triple of
_consecutive_ tetras will form a cover, but note that, although we might
expect it of a quasi-diatonic system, the union of the tonic, dominant,
and subdominant that Paul identifies is _not_ a cover of the scale.  In
fact, consecutive triples are the only sets which can form a cover for
SPM, and furthermore, due to "scale covariance" (described in my MTO
article), this characteristic is shared by _any_ 10-scale system based on
<3322> chords.  This can be checked with the simple 10X system given
above, or by listing a random 10-string such as <1714539926> and listing
its <3322> chords.  So the T-D-SD relationship doesn't provide "key
coherence" as we might expect.

        A second characteristic of all 10-scale/<3322> systems is that,
unlike 7-scale/<223>&<2221> systems and others, they aren't saturated with
what Eytan Agmon calls "efficient linear transformations."  In the usual
diatonic, for example, any triad can be linked to any other triad by
either a unison or a scale-step move.  In SPM/<3322> there are two
fundamental progressions that don't connect smoothly: those whose roots
are 4 and 6 scale steps apart, respectively, e.g.:

         I           V     I         VII

        18--------->16    18-------->20
        13-->(11)--> 9    13-------->13
         7---------> 4     7--------> 9
         0---------> 0     0-->(2)--> 4

whereas, for example, I-VI describes a typical ELT (smooth voice-leading):

         I     VI

        18---->18
        13---->11
         7----> 7
         0----> 2

Once again, this is true of all 10-scale/<3322> systems due to scale
covariance.

        Another interesting property that scale covariance carries through
all 10-scale/<3322> systems is the common-tone pattern.  Starting with any
chord in the list above, chord pairs n scale steps apart will have x tones
in common:

        n:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        x:   4 0 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 0

        Finally, the pattern of chord qualities is invariant for 10-scale
systems based on a scale string <xxyxxxyxxx> (where x ne y are any
integers) and generic string <3322> as above.  To illustrate, let Maj = a,
Min= a', Ma-mi = b, Mi-ma = b', and Aug = c; then the quality pattern will
always be some rotation of: a c c a' b a a a' a' b' (a skew-symmetric
pattern generated by the interaction of the scale and generic strings).

        The bottom line is, while scale tuning "matters" in many ways (not
the least of which is vertical & horizontal quality/modality, imparting a
defining "flavor" to a system), once you have chosen a scale, the real
work is just beginning since most scales offer multiple "geometric"
possibilities.  Let's now see what happens if we use a triad as a basic
chord in SPM.

        If we keep the demand for a 3:2 basis for a majority of chords (a
possibly psychologically reasonable but not logically necessary
condition), one plausible triad list uses the ME generic string <334>
which in effect simply deletes the top note of Paul's tetras yielding
triads:

        I     0  7 13   Maj
        II    2  9 16   Aug
        III   4 11 18   Aug
        IV    7 13 20   Min
        V     9 16  0   Maj
        VI   11 18  2   Maj
        VII  13 20  4   Maj
        VIII 16  0  7   Min
        IX   18  2  9   Min
        X    20  4 11   Min

This reduces the 5 tetrachord qualities to 3 trichord qualities: <769>
(Maj), <679> (Min), and <778> (Aug).

        First, this tells us something interesting about minimal covers
because it focuses attention on triads of identical quality.  We noted
above that the only cover (with the usual criterion for a triple of
chords) for tetras here was three consecutive tetras and therefore the
"tonic" could not participate with the "dominant" and "subdominant" to
form a cover. But the above list suggests that the cover principle works
differently in this scale's universe.  Three consecutive triads won't
cover the scale, but four consecutive triads will.  AND, by altering the
cover principle in this way, we find other, more interesting covers which
tend to alter the way we might envision the T-D relationship.  If we
collect all the Maj chords (I,V,VI,VII), say, we disclose a second minimal
cover which can be expanded to any four chords in that (root)
relationship.  Furthermore, while ELT (smooth voice leading) is fairly
depleted in this (triadic) interpretation, it is in full force for
quadruples of chords in a cover: the progression I-V-VI-VII-I is
ELT-saturated.  All of this suggests the interesting possibility that, in
this universe, there are _three_ "dominant" functions -- "dominant" (VII),
"subdominant" (V), and an auxiliary(?) "spanning dominant" (VI) since
I-VII and I-V are naturals for voice-leading, but you can't easily lead V
to VII without VI.

        This then brings us back to the status of Paul's original tetra
selection.  There are several ways to include triads here.  The obvious
way is to declare the triad to be the scale's basic sonority.  This would
then turn Paul's tetra into a "seventh" chord, and, while things would
look somewhat strange, the building blocks would pretty much resemble our
inhereted notions of chords.

        A second interpretation holds, I think, much more promise -- and
beside, it's more radical.  Here's where I jump off the high-dive and hope
there's water in the pool when I reach bottom.  First, a preliminary
exercise.  Take any typical 4-part harmonization of a hymn.  Play the
soprano & alto lines up an octave and the tenor & bass parts down an
octave.  Concentrate on hearing it, not as 4 lines and not as a succession
of chords, but as 2 lines, each of which consists of 2 lines.

        One of the questions I asked near the beginning concerned
"counterpoint" in megascale systems.  Let's assume that the tetra
described above is the basic harmonic sonority in our system analogous to
the triad in common practice theory (CPT).  In CPT there's a hierarchy,

        pitch (unad)
        interval (doad)
        triad
        (7th chord)

along with well-defined notions of consonance and dissonance, which taken
together help shape the "rules" of CPT counterpoint.  Replacing the CPT
triad with the SPM tetrachord, we now posit the following hierarchy:

        pitch (unad)
        interval (doad)
        hyperinterval (triad)
        tetrachord
        ("7th chord")

        Ignoring the 7-th chord to keep the illustration simple, focus on
the new structure, the triadic "hyperinterval" (HI).  Define a consonant
HI as the intervallic complex formed by any three pitches in a (consonant)
tetrachord (just as, ahistorically, we can define a consonant interval
backward as formed by any two pitches in a consonant triad).  Call this
set of 3 pitches a "hypertone" (HT).  We now have the basis for a
generalization of traditional counterpoint which might be called
"counterset."  Hypothetically, traditional counterpoint (in any historical
version) should turn out to be a category of counterset.

        What are the "rules" of counterset?  I haven't the foggiest idea.
The reason is that their definition, in my opinion, must hinge on
compositional praxis (if anyone decides to play with this idea -- and I
won't hold my breath). But a random "2-part" exercise (with no
"dissonance" allowed) might look like:

Counterset:   { 7 13 18}  { 9 16  4}  {11  2  7}  {13 20  4}  { 0  7 13}

CF:-)         { 0  7 18}  { 9 16  0}  {11 18  2}  {20  4  9}  { 0  7 18}

                  (I)         (V)        (VI)        (VII)        (I)

Set notation for HTs is retained to emphasize that the elements of any HT
can appear compositionally in any order.  Cantus firmus and Counterset
lines can be distinguished by tessitura, instrumentation, rhythm,
repetition, leaps, etc.  Any HT can appear as a simultaneity or an
arpeggiation.  At times the "lines" may not be aurally distinguishable at
all.  Dissonance at the HI level can be introduced by passing or other
non-chord HTs -- e.g., in VI above replace {11 2 7} with a HT belonging to
another chord, such as {20 4 11} from chord X (the totality, {2 4 11 18
20}, is not a consonant "chord" since it contains a foreign HT).

        In the preparatory exercise above, the 4-part chorale setting was
re-interpreted (in our new language) as a 2-part hypertonal setting.  If
the original tessitura is now reinstated, the hypertonal interpretation of
the setting, while not "incorrect," appears absurd -- it collapses into a
mere paper theory. In other words, there is generally not much use for
hypertonal theory in traditional musics, EVEN THOUGH they may be
considered as "first-order" hypertonal... you just can't hear it, nor
should you be able to, nor should you want to (IMHO). But when we get into
megascales, CPT can't handle the increase in volume -- of the individual
notes and of the new relationships that begin to appear (I know I'm into
opinion-mongering here).  So the next thing to appear is (as above) a
second-order hypertonal set of structures.  I've seen it occur time and
again, not just with Paul's scales.  And each time, these second-order
(and higher) structures bring with them a semblance of a very new (and
strange) type of order.

        (Two other lower-order hypertonal systems can also be posited --
chord clusters and tone rows, but I won't muddy the waters with those
right now (especially the latter which would lead to a deconstruction
that denies the existence of "atonality"))

        Returning to the original point, then, does tuning matter?  Yes,
but as I've been trying to demonstrate, megascales tend to gravitate into
"bundles" of megascales which are defined by the invariants shared by the
bundle.  And one of the most universal invariants appears to me to be
hypertonal ordering... the "laws" of counterpoint don't really change in
other universes, they just get really weird.  And this leads to the final
question which, for now, has to remain open: Can we hear it?  (Any
composers out there like to take on the challenge?)

Stephen brings up two important properties of the diatonic scale that
are not shared by my scale (a set of 10 in 22-tET). One is motivated
(perhaps) my a property I demand in my paper, that the scale be
completely covererable by three consonant chords. Stephen aptly points
out that in the diatonic case, this is often done using the I, IV, and V
chords. Another important example is I, II, and V; also I, IV, and VII
is often found in dorian or mixolydian rock music. All of these are
examples of three consecutive chords in a chain of fifths. Many rock
tunes, however, are based on three consecutive chords in the scale, such
as VI, VII, I in minor. So I don't view it as a great disadvantage that
my scale isn't covered by the tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords.
In fact, I recently stated on the List (with regard to my contest to
find another diatonic-like scale) that the property of coverability by
three consonant chords was not very important to me. In fact, I only
included it in my paper as a way of ruling out overly "complicated"
scales, such as 14 out of 26-tET, which I would otherwise have to
consider. I am now very happy to consider it, even though the (lack of)
clarity with which 4 or 5 chords might project a set of 14 notes clearly
presents a formidable compositional challenge.

Another property is that in the diatonic scale, any two triads can be
linked using only common tones and single-step-motion voice leading
(this was pointed out by Agmon). This is not true for the tetrads in the
decatonic scale. However, common practice music does not always progress
in this simple way -- passing tones and leaps are quite common, and
without them, one would have very little freedom in realizing a chord
progression or harmonizing a melody. So again, my scale posesses no
great disadvantage -- certain chord progressions will necessitate
passing tones or leaps. Decatonic melody will therefore be more active
than diatonic melody, in line with the greater number of tones that need
to be kept fresh in the mind of the listener.

As for "hypertones", I'm sure some very interesting music could be made
using this principle, particularly if each hypertone is associated with
a particluar timbre. But I would still want to make sure that the
ordinary "tones" making up the hypertones were forming good melodies, or
at least not forming awkward ones, since we are in some sense wired up
for speech recognition, and the human voice can only produce tones (i.e.
a fundamental and its harmonics, plus noise), not hypertones.

I forgot to point out that Medieval Western practice ("Gothic?") also
fails the three-chord-covering property. The consonant chords were
3-limit dyads, but three of those would cover at most 6 notes, while the
diatonic scale has 7. The diatonic scale with 3-limit harmony is another
system which I wanted to leave out of my paper for brevity, but clearly
cannot be dismissed altogether, as it was a language in which great
musical works were produced for a few centuries.

Ever heard of a scale that divides the double octave into 47 steps? It is non-
octave, naturally, and its equal-tempered version accomodates 7- and 13-limit
intervals exceptionally well. I came across it when playing a little with
"Pythagorean" scale approaches. For those interested I put it up on the Net:

I was wondering the same thing.  The last one I received was "TUNING digest
1604", on Sun, 6 Dec 1998.

To rule out the possibility that no one's submitted anything in a week, I'm
sending a copy of this to the tuning list.  (Hi everybody!)  Maybe
everyone's just real busy with Xmas shopping, or school finals, or
who-knows-what.

By the way, happy holidays, etc.

   In pursuing a conversation about what - emotion, right- or left-brain thinking
- is important in composition and performance, here is one of my replies.  Perhaps
you might find this interesting.

Hi Paul (and colleagues),

Re:  http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint

Thanks for trying out my tuning examples.

I created the files a couple of years ago for the exact same reason - I kept
hearing ABOUT just intonation, but I had never heard any decent examples.

I'm glad you wrote, because you reminded me that I needed to finish setting
up an "equipment check" web page.  Please give it a try:

        http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/wheelchk.htm

Let me know what happens!  Thanks again,

Message-ID: <19981217064353.20334.qmail@ella.mills.edu>

Sorry!!!!

As I'm sure some of you noticed, the list was down for a significant
amount of time.  The reason for this is that I left Mills back in June,
and I no longer really regularly check my mail here, as my life has moved on.
My successor at Mills is not interested in continuing with the listserver.

It is time to start to arrange to move the list.  I will provide all of
the support I possibly can to whomever decides to take it over - it would
be best to be moved to another list server running listproc 6.0, or listserv,
if possible.  I will even help get the listserver compiled and running  (but
not maintain it) if that is necessary.

If you have any ideas, please send the mail to my new address, madole@dnai.com.

Dave

Many of the larger CD makers provide a UPC code as part of their package at
no extra charge.

Bob Gilmore's Partch bio turns up an interesting bit in a letter from
1950.  Contrary to the Jon Szanto position regarding the substitution of a
sythesizer for the chromelodeon.  Mr. Szanto, I move for you to strike
from the record (e.g. your web site) this unfair statement.  The web
site reads: "If Mr.Reinhard has used a syth, then he has either
ignored or simply not comprehended a Partch truism..."

Partch writes in February to Lauriston Marshall (on p. 190 of the Gilmore
book) "I shall use the Chromelodeon very little from now on; its
musicality doesn't satisfy me, though it is indispensible from the
standpoint of theory..."the need either for an electronic tone or a reed
made out of some alloy less susceptible to temperature changes than
brass."

On April 6 Partch and Marshall won a Guggenheim Award for "studies toward
the development of an electronic instrument with electronic tone and
manual keyboard."  (Gilmore p. 191)

What do y'all think?  Should I be impeached?

Question number one is - How are the bars suspended
thus where are the nodes?

( are they held only at one end
        or are they drilled at two (or more) points
        and suspended there)
