These are scanned images from a facsimile edition of Marin Mersenne's _Harmonie Universelle_ from 1636. Each shows a different split-key arrangement for an organ keyboard; the file name gives the number of keys per octave. Most of them also have numbers to show the exact tuning proposed. The numbers are "string lengths" as opposed to frequencies. They are all taken from the _Livre de l'orgue_ section of the treatise, which shows organ construction in great detail.

The last image, mers18-24-26 has a different number of keys per octave. It is printed mirror-reversed in the original treatise, and I have not corrected that (though it would be easy to do in any graphics program).
