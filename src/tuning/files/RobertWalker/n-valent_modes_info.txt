n-valent_et_modes.lmd

lists all the n-valent et modes in the SCALA archive (n>=2)
where n-valent = all interval classes have exactly n sizes of intervals.

The modes are all from the SCALA file modename.html

Typical entry:
1 3 1 1 2 2 1 1  v___3md_n__8_class_1_bbaabbb_class_3_aaabbaa_class_5_bbaabbb_class_7_aaabbaa_ Verdi's Scala enigmatica
The 1 3 1 1 2 2 1 1 lists the step sizes of the mode.

v___3 = it is of valency 3, i.e. each interval class comes in 3 sizes.
n__8 - scale has 8 notes
m = includes the midpoint as one of the interval sizes in one of the classes.
d = has a duplicated interval size in at least one class.
I.e.an interval size that can be made from the steps in more than one way.
Ex, LS = MM for this scale. (L, M, S = large, middle and small step sizes).

class_5_bbaabbb = the scale can be generated using generators of two sizes from class 5
using the pattern bbaabbb where a > b,

Here, class 1 = the steps of the scale, so class 5 = intervals made up of 5 steps.

Some n-valent scales need n generators to generate them for every class.

In:
class_1_z_3_a_2_[_2]_b_1_[_5]_
a, b are the generators in decreasing size. a > b > c (if present),..

z_3 = the unique interval left over when you have made all the other notes.
It is of size 3

a_2_[_2}_ = a is of size 2, and is used twice.
b_1_[_5]_ = b is of size 1 and used 5 times.
bbaabbb = the pattern of generators

Dupl.__5__0__1__1__1__1__1__0_
= there are 5 duplicated interval sizes in total
0__1__1__1__1__0_
= lists the duplicated intervals for each class, in order
class 1, class 2, ...,
