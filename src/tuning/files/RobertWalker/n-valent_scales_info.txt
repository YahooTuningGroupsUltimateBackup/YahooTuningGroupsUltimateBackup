n-valent_scales.txt 

lists all the n-valent scales in the SCALA archive (n>=2)
where n-valent = all interval classes have exactly n sizes of intervals.

Typical entry:
 v___3md_n_12_class_5_aaaaaaaaaba_class_7_aaaaaaaaaba_ arabic1.scl | From Fortuna. Try C or G major

v___3 = valency 3
n_12 = number of notes in the scale.

arabic1.scl is the name of the SCALA scale. (the definitions are left out to make the file much smaller,
and because it is then easier to read).

m = includes the midpoint 2^(1/2) as one of the interval sizes in one of the classes.

d = has a duplicated interval size in at least one class.
I.e.an interval size that can be made from the steps in more than one way.
Ex, LMMMS = MMMMM for this scale. (L, M, S = large, middle and small step sizes).

The class_5_aaaaaaaaaba shows a pattern of generators that can be used to make this scale, where 
the generators a and b are both intervals of interval class 5 (i.e. made up of 5 steps of the scale).

By repeatedly adding the intervals in the pattern showing, and reducing into the octave (or more
generally, the formal octave), you can generate the scale.

Some n-valent scales need n generators to generate them for every class.
No generator info is shown for these.

class_5_z_550_a_500_[10]_b_450_aaaaaaaaaba
- all numbers are in cents unless shown in ratio notation as 3/1 etc.
a, b, ... are the generators in decreasing order of size.
Herem, 500 and 450 are the sizes of the generators in cents.

Numbers in square brackets show how many times the generator is used - if none shown,it is used once.
So here, a is used 10 times, and b, once. 

z is the interval that closes the cycle to get back to the note you started from.

Dupl._10__0__1__1__1__1__2__1__1__1__1__0_ 
lists the number of duplicated interval sizes for each class. The first 0 is for
the steps themselves, and the last 0 is for their complements.
