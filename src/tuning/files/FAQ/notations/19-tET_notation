Q. How does one notate music correctly in 19-tET?

A. 19-tET is actually an HISTORICAL tuning.  It is one of a series of meantones 
which work on the "traditional" five lined staff!  Our "traditional" staff originated
with an early "Pythagorean" tuning of pure fifths and has been used for several historical
notations since that time. This is one of them.

If one is to notate 19-tET as a MEANTONE, in the traditional historical usage, one uses
NON-EQUIVALENT enharmonics.  In other words, C# and Db become two different notes!  The
correct 19-tone pitches for this scale would be as follows:

C, C#, Db, D natural, D#, Eb, E natural, E#, F, F#, Gb, G natural, G#, 
Ab, A natural, A#, Bb, B natural, B#

19 pitches...
