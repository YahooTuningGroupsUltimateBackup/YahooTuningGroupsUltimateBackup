Short expo:

$.$.$
as the first line of text.

$.$.trines
as the section header

See $$.trines$
to refer to it

See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$$

to refer to another faq, where the title

$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$
is the short one you see in the tree

To refer to a section within another faq:

See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$.trines$

to refer to a section in another faq.

In html
$.$.$
as the first line of text.

Use the html header 1, 2, 3
type headings for the sections.

Use same method as before to refer to another faq.

Use
$.unison vectors
to make a bookmark in your faq that anyone else
can link to.

Details:

.................In plain text files................

If you want your entry to be automatically numbered in the ASCII FAQ
place
$.$.$
as the first line of text.

Then whenever you want a new section header, add a new line immediately
before the title of the section, as
$.$.$...name
with the number of $.s giving the number of levels in the numbering system.

e.g.

$.main 
A gentle introduction to neo-Gothic progressions (1)
.....
$.$.trines
Trines, quads, and intonational flavors
....
$.$.$.most proximal
Part 1 of 2: Most proximal quads


Now if you want to refer to one of the sections, do it as

See $$.trines$

I.e.
$$.bookmark name$

Be sure to include the . in $$.trines, as that makes it clear
you are referring to another section in the same faq, rather
than another faq.

Also be sure to double the initial $$ to show that it is a link.
Notice the final $ as well.

To refer to an entry in another faq, do it as

See $$Joseph Pehrson$19-tET notations$$

i.e. 

$$author$title$$

Notice the final $$

The up to date FAQ will have the author listed for each entry, at the head
of the page, so that you can do this.
(any objections to that?)

The title is the title as shown in the tree.

To refer to a section within another ascii faq, use

See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$.trines$

I.e.
$$author$tree title$bookmark$

You can read the bookmark by looking it up in the draft tree.

If you do need to use a line beginning
$.$.$...
(perhaps in an ascii diagram)
switch it off with

$$off

then back on again with
$$on

This can be done at any point, and the lines
$$on
$$off
will be removed completely from the final version, so there will be
no extra blank lines.

Similarly
$.trines
will be removed, leaving extra lines, when the next line is
made into a section heading as, say

In the html version of your document, your section headers will be made
into the various header levels for html, and your references will
be made into links to the section headers.

So in the final FAQ, 

$.$.trines
Trines, quads, and intonational flavors
becomes
.....1.1 Trines, quads, and intonational flavors

.....................in html..........................

If you want your entry to be automatically numbered in the ASCII FAQ
place
$.$.$
as the first line of text.

This means, first line of visible text in the document.

Now, make sure you use the Header 1, Header 2, Header 3,... styles
for section headings.

Now the program can treat any header 1 text as a section header 
for the top level in the numbering system for your file.

Header 2 text will be for the next level,
and so on.

Since header 1 is rather large, you can start with header 2 if you
prefer, or header 3 or smaller.

You can still use the ascii method too.

E.g. to refer to another entry in the faq, either use the url, or probably
_better_, refer to it as

See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$.trines

In your html you can also use bookmarks in the usual way.

In the ascii conversion, a link to a bookmarks will be
converted to reference to the ascii header for whatever section it is in.

If you want one of your bookmarks to be referrable from
any other faq, then make a new line of text immediately before it.

E.g.
$.unison vectors

Then anyone else who wants to refer to that section can refer to it
using

See $$your name$your faq$.unison vectors$

as before.

You can also use it yourself within your own faq, using See $$.unison vectors$$

As before, the $$. at the beginning indicates that it is a reference to
a section in the same faq, rather than one in another faq.

The bookmarks will work in the "on site" faq whenever it is next 
refreshed.

To see them, in order to link to them, you look at the "working draft" faq.
