No two are exactly alike, not even in the same rank made by \nthe same \n&gt; person.\n\nditto.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, there&#39;s enough variation deliberate or not to keep the \n&gt; pipes sounding out of phase.

And I&#39;ve never dedected any sounding intervals or chords \nperfectly in \n&gt; phase.\n\ndid you ever *try* physically connecting (say through *very* close \nproximity, so air vibrations effectively connect) two organ pipes \nwhich, separately, were tuned to within a cent or so of a simple just \nratio? i guess not, as the result which we&#39;re arguing about is not \none you would have wanted anyway.\n\nalso, a pendantic note about &quot;in phase&quot; and &quot;out of phase&quot; -- both \nsituations decribe phase-locked just intonation (especially 1/1s), \nit&#39;s just that in the former you have constructive interference and \nin the latter, destructive interference. both are probably equally \nundesirable to you -- what you seem to be after is (very slow) \nbeating.\n\nwhich of course is what you get even if you play a &quot;JI&quot; electric \nguitar (plucked strings are slightly inharmonic), especially one with \nfrets placed in integer ratio positions relative to the nut (i.e., \nnot compensated for the slight deflection involved in pushing the \nstring down to the fingerboard).\n\n\n"

On the other hand, the affect that different tunings has on me, as a listener, would suggest that merely reading cents notation is not the entire story.\n\n&gt; I could not imagine a SINGLE players of those instruments playing \n&gt; more than one tuning on a single concert (unless they can respond \n&gt; to cents).\n\nSo if you can read cents, you can play as many intonations as you want, but if you read differing notations (which are simply symbols for cents equivalencies), you can&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t add up, or at the very least underestimates the capabilities of good players.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to stir anything up\n\nHey, same here! :) I just don&#39;t want others that might be &#39;listening in&#39; to this thread to get overly pessimistic about what people can and can&#39;t do. And I think there is a big world out there beyond the Big Apple.\n\n&gt; Do you think I am just a Svengali that can seduce players to play \n&gt; for me?\n\nNo, I think you are a very lucky person to be in the situation you are in. Lucky *and* hard-working.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

I have the impression that whe=\r\nn listening to such a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; structure, one starts expecting further modula=\r\ntions, and looses \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need of remainig around a static tonality.  \n=\r\n\n\nthen Jon..\n&gt; &gt; That would certainly be my impression. Both with JI and va=\r\nrious\n&gt; &gt; ETs and temperments, I find that many times I lose that wanting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to home back in on one tonic. In fact, that is one of the reasons\n&gt; &gt; of=\r\n getting away from 12tet (at least for me) - the ability to\n&gt; &gt; wander into=\r\n new and valid (harmonic) territory, free from\n&gt; &gt; references to &#39;the past&#39;=\r\n.\n\nYeah... with JI one finds no limits when dinamically travelling \nthrough=\r\n new harmonic spaces.. \nI remember having made some long recordings which m=\r\nade harmonic sense \nwhen listened linearly, but were surprisingly out of tu=\r\nne when \nreproduced as randomly ordered sections. There are great \npossibil=\r\nities when playing around with dynamic reference, modulations \nand short ti=\r\nme memory!      \n\n\nand monz..\n\n&gt; one thing that i thought of right away fro=\r\nm Kiko&#39;s description\n&gt; is &quot;commatic drift&quot; -- when singers sing in strict J=\r\nI and the\n&gt; fact that the 2nd degree of the diatonic scale has to be tuned\n=\r\n&gt; one way to be consonant with the II chord and another way\n&gt; (a syntonic c=\r\nomma higher) to be consonant with the V chord.\n&gt; \n&gt; some folks around here =\r\n(paul erlich comes to mind immediately)\n&gt; are extremely bothered by commati=\r\nc drift ... others, like myself,\n&gt; tend to not mind it much, depending most=\r\nly on how long is the\n&gt; time frame in which it happens, i.e., if the musica=\r\nl phrase is\n&gt; long enough i won&#39;t really notice it.\n&gt; \n\nOk.. if enough time=\r\n passes between modulations, you won=B4t notice the \naccumulatory effect of=\r\n using &quot;commadic drifts&quot; or not, but that also \ndepends on the complexity o=\r\nf the factors involved in the successive \nmodulations. \nFifths won`t cause =\r\nbig problems.. but i`m shure that other iterative \ntempered modulations app=\r\nlied to the tonic don`t work that well, in \ncomparisson to just modulations=\r\n...\n \n&gt; Kiko, how about a more detailed description of what you&#39;re\n&gt; doing,=\r\n along with links to the audio?\n\n\nShure! I`m uploading some tracks to mp3.c=\r\nom   \nI`ll let you know. \nI`ll make another more detailed post on arithmeti=\r\nc and geometric \naproach to harmony.. \n\n\n\n\n"

Mind you, this is some collection of musicians, ready to start recording, and when they start, they can&#39;t stop for the 22 or so minutes while the machine is actually cutting grooves into Side 1 of the master disc.\n\nAnd, indeed, they did yield some incredible performances, both sonically and musically. Often they were cutting edge jazz or pop groups, or top-notch classical players; imagine working on your rep, and then sitting there and *knowing* there was no &quot;Take 2&quot;, no &quot;cut and paste&quot;, no &quot;hey guys, I muffed a note in the bridge&quot;.

They have a part of a shelf for Elvis, and oddly it&#39;s next to cooking.

Where do you \nsee a specific *misrepresentation* of the technicalities? \n\nyour paper says that johnston&#39;s piano sonata uses \n&gt; two or more conflicting just tunings while in fact it&#39;s tuned to a \n&gt; single 81-tone chunk of the lattice. \n\nYou&#39;ve got me here - I should have written that Johnston uses a *single* \nconflicting tuning. (It is still &quot;conflicting,&quot; however. Intentionally so, as I understand \nit.)\n\nin nearly every case your \n&gt; statements in this section seem to come out of a shallow survey of \n&gt; the theory and practice of just intonation and related models.\n\nPerhaps the sheer number of sources cited could seem &quot;shallow,&quot; or small, \nespecially when compared with the resources of tuning experts such as the many \nwho are members of this list. And if one hoped for me to delve into the particulars \nof just intonation and its cousins, one had the wrong expectations of this essay and \nwould certainly be disappointed. However, my conception of the basic premise of \ncontemporary pure tuning trends is wholly intact so far (and has been in fact  \nreaffirmed by my visits to the Tuning List), and was initially formed through a \nstudy of the writings of many of the leading practitioners that was anything but \nshallow.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; but the point here is that you focus on beating, and beating is but a \n&gt; small piece of the puzzle. \n\nI realize that beating is only one of the issues. I could have been more thorough in \nmy portrayal of the theoretical premise I criticize, e.g. discussing the human \nneurological side of the argument. This is probably a valid criticism of my paper. \nBut I don&#39;t believe it would have had any bearing on the more important, \nfundamental arguments I make regarding the influence of musical context, culture, \nimagination, etc.\n\nNonetheless, see David Doty&#39;s statements about beating in his &quot;response&quot; to my \nessay. &quot;...the consonance to which I refer is essentially an objective phenomenon \nthat can potentially be detected by anyone with normal hearing. It results from the \nabsence (or, at least, the minimization) of disturbance from beating partials and \nthe reinforcement of interval identity by supportive difference tones and \nperiodicity pitch.&quot; I know some people on the list do not share Doty&#39;s views, but as \n(Director? President?) of the Just Intonation Network, I think he can be considered \none important and influential spokesperson for the movement. Of course, Kyle \nGann also gives *great* importance to beating as evidence of the flaw of equal \ntemperament in his essay on JI on his site. Not that you all share his views, either \n(beats - red meat - violence, etc).\n\ncombinational tones are yet another piece \n&gt; that we haven&#39;t even brought up yet in this discussion.\n&gt;\n\nTrue. What about them? (As far as my argument is concerned.)\n \n\n&gt; you say that the only intervals just intonation theory would consider \n&gt; truly consonant are 2:1, 3:2, 5:4, and maybe 7:4. but this wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; even allow you to construct a consonant triad, since either a major \n&gt; or minor triad, while containing a 3:2 and a 5:4, must also contain a \n&gt; 6:5.\n&gt; \n\nWell, yes. This would only support my point as far as beatlessness-as-criterion is \nconcerned. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; now maybe i&#39;m reading this wrong, but it sounds like you&#39;re saying \n&gt; that &quot;just intonation theory&quot; (as if it were a monolithic entity) \n&gt; hasn&#39;t followed its ideas to their logical conclusions about all \n&gt; intervals in the continuum. \n\nIn the context of that statement, I was referring to that aspect of JI theory which is \nconcerned with beats. \n\nand that if it did, it would find that \n&gt; the minor sixth (which was, after all, the most recent of our \n&gt; consonances to be accepted as such, according to margo) must in fact \n&gt; be considered dissonant regardless of its tuning. well, since you \n&gt; cite helmholtz, he most certainly did follow his ideas to their \n&gt; logical conclusions, and came up with this graph, which shows the \n&gt; minor sixth as a relatively harmonious interval:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/helmholtz.html\n&gt; \n&gt; so are you saying helmholtz went wrong in his logic somewhere? where? \n\nAs you yourself noted above, I didn&#39;t write that Helmholtz didn&#39;t follow his ideas to \ntheir logical conclusion, but that &quot;just intonation theory&quot; doesn&#39;t. Although \nHelmholtz was an advocate of pure tunings, I never intended to implicate him as a \nspokesman for the contemporary movement. I simply cited beats in one paragraph \n(and made a passing reference to Helmholtz&#39;s theory), and made this statement \nabout JI theory two paragraphs later, having already earlier cited certain other, \nspecific people as &quot;representatives&quot; of  the JI movement in pages 162-164. It didn&#39;t \noccur to me that it could seem that I was including Helmholtz himself in this \nstatement, but now I guess I can see how this interpretation could also be made. \nAnd true, with the wording &quot;just intonation theory&quot; in that sentence I seem to be \ncreating an inaccurate picture of just intonation as a single, monolithic entity.\n\nBut, OK, so this graph shows the minor sixth to be relatively harmonious, and \nrelatively &quot;rough&quot; at the same time - in fact it&#39;s just about as rough as the \naugmented fourth I also cited in my essay. (Though the F-sharp is not marked on \nthe graph, you can choose any spot in between the F and the G and see that the \nroughness tends to be about the same as at the A-flat. Am I misreading this?) Any \nway, how does this affect what I wrote in my essay about the beating of the minor \nsixth? \n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But anyone with even a little bit of background in tonal theory \n&gt; &gt;knows why A-flat  \n&gt; &gt; and B sound dissonant in that context,\n&gt; \n&gt; knows why? really knows why?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;and I don&#39;t consider the theory there to be \n&gt; &gt; too &quot;deep.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; well then, for the sake of putting all the cards on the table, why \n&gt; don&#39;t you lay it out for us as you see it? (i studied tonal theory in \n&gt; college, but i&#39;d rather launch from a point as close as possible to \n&gt; your view of it.)\n\nWhat does that little parenthesis mean? Anyway, rather than me playing a guessing \ngame, why don&#39;t you just tell me your explanation of the tension in that sort of \naugmented second, beyond the standard \nlowered-sixth-degree-and-raised-seventh-degree-needing-to-resolve type of \nexplanation?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t feel I would be educating the average PNM reader with such \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; explanation. Not only that, but I feel it would have been a \n&gt; digression, since my \n&gt; &gt; point was to give a simple, commonplace example of how the musical \n&gt; context can \n&gt; &gt; alter our perception of intervals, to support my other main point \n&gt; about the JI \n&gt; &gt; dogma concerning consonance and dissonance.  \n&gt; \n&gt; my point in bringing it up was not to suggest that you ought to \n&gt; burden your readers with a digression. rather, this is something that \n&gt; i would hope you might think a little deeper about, in order to \n&gt; better understand what is going on with consonance and dissonance in \n&gt; a triadic diatonic language, so that one might set out to think about \n&gt; what might happen in a non-diatonic, perhaps &quot;microtonal&quot; (however \n&gt; you define it) language, without simply leaving it as a matter \n&gt; of &quot;alchemy&quot; . . .\n\nWith my use of the word &quot;alchemy&quot; I was not implying anything metaphysical; it \nwas intended as a kind of colorful reference to how various factors (e.g. traditional \ntonal harmonic structures) in a certain musical context  can &quot;transform&quot; something \nwe might expect, in theory, to be a consonance into a dissonance, and vice-versa. \nFurthermore, \n\n perhaps this kind of thinking is too far off your \n&gt; star charts for you to consider right now, \n\none of my points in that part of the article was to propose, in passing, looking \nbeyond the consonance/dissonance dichotomy. But, yes, it would be interesting to \npresent certain microtonal intervals in different musical contexts and see how their \neffect changes, either within a &quot;consonance/dissonance&quot; scheme or in some \nbroader sense. It was beyond the scope of this paper, for sure (but &quot;star charts&quot;?). \nMaybe it could be something worth studying in the future, though it does seem \nsuch a subjective matter, impossible to codify even if one wanted to.\n\n\n\n\n"

Yours also would be a fine way to make \nthe same point about culture and background, but I don&#39;t agree that the rest is \nsuperfluous (obviously).\n \n&gt; &gt; With regard to this first criticism of mine: I realize that I have \n&gt; cited only the most \n&gt; &gt; commonly and prominently stated arguments in support of pure \n&gt; tuning, regarding \n&gt; &gt; beating \n&gt; \n&gt; but you&#39;ve misunderstood, and drawn false conclusions, even from \n&gt; those. i made this point with a citation of helmholtz; your response \n&gt; seems to be simply to ignore what i&#39;m saying.\n\n No, you just need to tell me *what* false conclusions from Helmholtz I am \ndrawing in my essay. All you&#39;ve said so far was that he demonstrated that a minor \nsixth was a harmonious interval.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; since you&#39;ve made statements about &quot;just intonation&quot; rather than \n&gt; about particular authors, \n\nHow can you say this? Go back and look - I made statements about the claims of \nseveral specific people.\n\none would assume you&#39;d gone through at \n&gt; least the majority of the relevant works in a major university \n&gt; library -- \n\nTell me, do you think I spent three years writing my doctoral thesis *without* \ngoing to major university libraries and finding all the relevent works I could, and \nwhen I couldn&#39;t find them ordering them through the mail? I&#39;ll do us both a favor \nand forget you even wrote that.\n\nif not, wouldn&#39;t it be better to simply name and cite the \n&gt; items you&#39;re objecting to, to avoid inadvertantly offending everyone \n&gt; else who&#39;s used the term?\n&gt; \n\nDid I not name and cite the items I was objecting to, thoroughly and methodically? \n\n&gt; \n&gt; the &quot;imagination&quot; argument doesn&#39;t fly as far as i&#39;m concerned. \n&gt; unless one is living in a solipsistic musical world, one has to get \n&gt; one&#39;s musical ideas across to a listener. in order to do so, one can \n&gt; either rely on extra-musical communication, or else one *has* to \n&gt; appeal to either culturally or biologically common features in the \n&gt; listening minds of the composer and the listener. if not, \n&gt; then &quot;imagined&quot; meanings such as those of &quot;solidity&quot; will have no \n&gt; meaning outside the imagination of the composer.\n\nI cited the imagination as one contributing factor, along with acoustics, musical \ncontext, and cultural background. Of course, if it was the only factor there could \nhardly be any musical communication, ever. But I never implied this. \n\n&gt; the middle paragraph on page 167 again invokes the &quot;straw man&quot;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;. . . it would obviously be futile, even absurd, to try to avoid the \n&gt; feared &#39;incorrectness&#39; of this majority of relationships by \n&gt; restricting oneself to simple pure triads or seventh chords in one&#39;s \n&gt; music&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; which is not an argument against any contemporary just intonationist \n&gt; i can think of; and moreover, even restricting oneself in such a \n&gt; manner does not imply any restrictions whatsoever on the melodic \n&gt; intervals that may occur (q.v. the blackjack example again). since \n&gt; melodic intervals are the primary focus of the second part of your \n&gt; paper, there really seems to be a huge gap between the first part and \n&gt; the second part, such that one wonders what they&#39;re doing in the same \n&gt; paper.\n\nI see no connection (nor lack of connectedness) between these two things. It seems \nlike a big leap you are making. The second part of my paper is about composing \nwith microtones entirely independently of just intonation concerns, so why would JI \nrestrictions or lack-of-them-in-melodic-intervals  be relevent there?\n\n sure, one can make \n&gt; concordances sound &quot;jarring&quot; and out-of-place in a context where \n&gt; dissonance is expected, but this only serves to demonstrate that \n&gt; there&#39;s a universally perceived difference in quality between the \n&gt; extremes of these categories. \n\nI don&#39;t believe any dissonance is expected in the Bartok example I gave. (But try \nMikrokosmos no. 65 from the same book, Vol. II, for another, maybe even better \nexample of this, with harsh, rough, jarring open fifths and no harmonic \nexpectations of any kind.) And fifths or octaves can sound &quot;jarring&quot; if you just sit \nand pound a bunch of them out violently on the piano, for that matter. So musical \ncontext can include, aside from voice-leading and harmonic &quot;expectations,&quot; \nsomething as simple as dynamics and articulation. If there is something that is pure \nand perfect about the octave, well this is easily achievable, but it does depend on \nhow this octave is treated by the composer. If someone hammers it away \nruthlessly at a fortississimo dynamic, then that all of that purity or stability is going \nto go out the window. \n\nMaybe it seems like I am confusing issues now, confusing functional harmonic \nstability with the effects of dynamics and articulation. But this is exactly my point, \nthat  psychoacoustic arguments about harmony that are *qualitative* (simple \nratios=correct, irrational intervals=mistake) cannot lead us into the music itself \nwhen they ignore the immeasurable influence of so many other factors. And \nbecause of this I remain highly sceptical of the value - beyond its idiosyncratic \napplication to the work of any one individual and his/her art - of any tuning dogma, \n*in our day and age*.\n\nGann writes that a 680-cent fifth sounds &quot;scary.&quot; *Any* fifth can sound scary, or it \ncan sound ethereal, depending on what you do with it. Give me any interval and I&#39;ll \nmake it pretty, or I&#39;ll make it scary (of course, these characterizations are matters \nof opinion...). This is not the same thing as saying that all intervals are the same, \nit&#39;s just pointing out that all intervals are potential materials with which to create a \nhuge variety of kinds of great music. This seems so painfully obvious, in fact.\n\nopen fifths and octaves can \n&gt; sound &quot;incorrect&quot; when approched in parallel motion in some styles; \n&gt; this in no way negates the fact that the perception of these \n&gt; intervals involves less neurological uncertainty than the perception \n&gt; of the &quot;richer&quot; intervals of tonal music -- it&#39;s just that the sudden \n&gt; reduction of uncertainty is damaging to the musical texture. \n\nI&#39;d be curious to get a reading of someone&#39;s &quot;neurological uncertainty&quot; with my \npounding octaves out on the piano at triple forte example. But I&#39;m sure I sound \nvery crude. \n\nso here, \n&gt; i find myself in agreement with you that it&#39;s absurd to \n&gt; associate &quot;correctness&quot; with a maximization of the prevalence of the \n&gt; simplest possible ratios in music. but who does? name one person \n&gt; whose statements solidly match such a point of view.\n\nWe&#39;re just talking about octaves (I used octaves and fifths in the paper as an \nexample) because the octave would represent the most perfect harmonic structure \naccording to the premise and the underlying logic of just intonation. (Actually, \naccording to Partch, maybe it would be the unison?) Anyway, I never claimed that \nthe JI composers I cited in the essay maximize the octave in their music. Though I \nhave heard plenty of JI music that seems to be &quot;maximizing&quot; partials 1-7 or 1-9. I \ndon&#39;t want to get into that, though. \n\n(BTW, Here&#39;s your one person: David Doty, again, since I have his website handy. \n&quot;Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can be \nrepresented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied preference for the \nsmallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot; This is the first \nstatement in his definition of JI from his primer. And, further down: &quot;The \nsimple-ratio intervals upon which Just Intonation is based ...are what the human \nauditory system recognizes as consonance, if it ever has the opportunity to hear \nthem in a musical context.&quot; I&#39;m just sitting at my computer right at this moment; it \nprobably wouldn&#39;t be too hard to find more.)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; if taken to its extreme, this &quot;just intonation&quot; view would allow only \n&gt; the very simplest and least ambiguous interval, the 1/1, to ever \n&gt; occur as a verticality in music (while of course saying nothing about \n&gt; disallowing any conceivable melodic/horizontal intervals). and where \n&gt; can one find examples of such an aesthetic? ironically enough, in the \n&gt; second part of your paper!\n&gt;\n\nYou&#39;re definitely going to need to explain that one. \n \n&gt; &gt; I personally \n&gt; &gt; may not undestand why one would use JI if one doesn&#39;t believe in \n&gt; its basic premise, \n&gt; &gt; but that&#39;s none of my business.\n&gt; \n&gt; then why claim that some just intonation composers, any in fact that \n&gt; use &quot;interesting&quot; (for you) sonorities or intervals, are violating \n&gt; the basic premise of just intonation? without providing a single \n&gt; example of a composer who writes music consistent with the basic \n&gt; premise of just intonation as you see it? if you truly felt that it&#39;s \n&gt; none of your business, you wouldn&#39;t have made this claim. \n\nYou&#39;re mixing up issues. I didn&#39;t claim in my paper that Sims, Stahnke, Johnston \nand Harrison don&#39;t *believe* in the basic premise of JI. I *did* claim that these \nfour composers seem, in certain pieces, to be &quot;taking fundamental liberties with \nthe just intonation model, admittedly or not,&quot; and that is a different thing. I \nsuppose one could say that if a composer *intentionally* takes liberties with the JI \nmodel, as Stahnke has done in pieces like &quot;Partch Harp,&quot; in which he juxtaposes \ntwo conflicting just tunings, that this seems to imply he/she must not believe in its \nbasic premise. But that would be jumping to conclusions. \n\nNotice, too, the difference between my &quot;taking liberties&quot; language and your \n&quot;violating&quot; memory of what I wrote. Taking liberties is what real artists often need \nto do, in my opinion. \n\n did you run your &quot;taken \n&gt; fundamental liberties with the just intonation model&quot; claim by any of \n&gt; the composers you accuse of doing so, to see how they would respond, \n&gt; before putting such a statement in print? i doubt it -- either way, \n&gt; it&#39;s now irrevocably &quot;your business&quot;!\n&gt; \nI accused no one. I would never &quot;accuse&quot; a composer of something he/she had \ncomposed. I do make the claim you&#39;ve quoted, but there was no  accusatory tone. \nIn fact, the main purpose of the section you are referring to (p170-171) was to \npraise the some of the music of these four people and to admit that some good \nmusic has come out if it, despite the theory (as well as to conclude by stating once \nagain my belief that one could just as well get the funky intervals directly, without \nall the theory). I don&#39;t believe I needed their permission to write this, as it is \nunderstood clearly to be *my* view of things. \n\nBut for that matter, since you ask, I *have* consulted with Stahnke personally \nabout this very issue. And I knew that Ezra (a friend) would hate what I wrote \nthere. On the other hand, he already knows my views; he knows that I don&#39;t share \nhis theory but do admire his music. \n\n\n\n\n"

Where do you \n&gt; see a specific *misrepresentation* of the technicalities?\n\nin the dissertation, otonal and utonal, for example, are not defined \ncorrectly. it has no bearing on anything else, however.\n \n&gt; your paper says that johnston&#39;s piano sonata uses \n&gt; &gt; two or more conflicting just tunings while in fact it&#39;s tuned to \na \n&gt; &gt; single 81-tone chunk of the lattice. \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve got me here - I should have written that Johnston uses a \n*single* \n&gt; conflicting tuning. (It is still &quot;conflicting,&quot; however. \nIntentionally so, as I understand \n&gt; it.)\n\nit is &quot;conflicting&quot; in the same sense that a single diatonic scale in \nji or meantone is &quot;conflicting&quot;. so yes, definitely a single tuning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; but the point here is that you focus on beating, and beating is \nbut a \n&gt; &gt; small piece of the puzzle. \n\n&gt; combinational tones are yet another piece \n&gt; &gt; that we haven&#39;t even brought up yet in this discussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; True. What about them? (As far as my argument is concerned.)\n\nthey operate very differently from beating, and very specifically to \nproduce audible (but not necessarily undesirable) disturbances in \nchords that are not simple harmonic series subsets. as far as your \nargument is concerned . . . i&#39;m afraid it&#39;s been too long, i plead \nthe fifth!\n\n&gt; &gt; you say that the only intervals just intonation theory would \nconsider \n&gt; &gt; truly consonant are 2:1, 3:2, 5:4, and maybe 7:4. but this \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; even allow you to construct a consonant triad, since either a \nmajor \n&gt; &gt; or minor triad, while containing a 3:2 and a 5:4, must also \ncontain a \n&gt; &gt; 6:5.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, yes. This would only support my point as far as beatlessness-\nas-criterion is \n&gt; concerned. \n\nhow so?\n\n&gt; &gt; now maybe i&#39;m reading this wrong, but it sounds like you&#39;re \nsaying \n&gt; &gt; that &quot;just intonation theory&quot; (as if it were a monolithic entity) \n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t followed its ideas to their logical conclusions about all \n&gt; &gt; intervals in the continuum. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the context of that statement, I was referring to that aspect of \nJI theory which is \n&gt; concerned with beats. \n\nok -- i took it out of context -- i apologize.\n\n&gt; &gt; and that if it did, it would find that \n&gt; &gt; the minor sixth (which was, after all, the most recent of our \n&gt; &gt; consonances to be accepted as such, according to margo) must in \nfact \n&gt; &gt; be considered dissonant regardless of its tuning. well, since you \n&gt; &gt; cite helmholtz, he most certainly did follow his ideas to their \n&gt; &gt; logical conclusions, and came up with this graph, which shows the \n&gt; &gt; minor sixth as a relatively harmonious interval:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/helmholtz.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; so are you saying helmholtz went wrong in his logic somewhere? \nwhere? \n&gt; \n&gt; As you yourself noted above, I didn&#39;t write that Helmholtz didn&#39;t \nfollow his ideas to \n&gt; their logical conclusion, but that &quot;just intonation theory&quot; \ndoesn&#39;t. Although \n&gt; Helmholtz was an advocate of pure tunings, I never intended to \nimplicate him as a \n&gt; spokesman for the contemporary movement.\n\n&quot;just intonation theory&quot; won&#39;t do it then. you have to implicate the \nimpicated.\n\n&gt; But, OK, so this graph shows the minor sixth to be relatively \nharmonious, and \n&gt; relatively &quot;rough&quot; at the same time - in fact it&#39;s just about as \nrough as the \n&gt; augmented fourth I also cited in my essay. (Though the F-sharp is \nnot marked on \n&gt; the graph, you can choose any spot in between the F and the G and \nsee that the \n&gt; roughness tends to be about the same as at the A-flat. Am I \nmisreading this?)\n\nnot at all -- the tritone can be quite harmonious, in the opinion of \nhelmholtz and much of the rest of &quot;just intonation theory&quot;, \nparticularly in the context of a &quot;barbershop&quot; dominant seventh chord. \ni don&#39;t necessarily subscribe to this theory fully, but i believe it \nplays a role, and is not the worst foundation upon which to build new \nexplorations.\n\n&gt; Any \n&gt; way, how does this affect what I wrote in my essay about the \nbeating of the minor \n&gt; sixth? \n\nmy point is that many even more consonant intervals, even major \nthirds in lower registers, can exhibit beating, and yet this rarely \ndisturbs the &quot;just intonation theorist&quot; -- who instead tends to \ndiscover additional, *new* consonant intervals, as they tingle his or \nher palate in familiar yet unfamiliar ways. there is beating but \nthere is also concord between harmonics, between combinational tones, \nvirtual pitches align, the beats themselves form a consistent rhythm, \netc. these sorts of effects are to a sonority what pungent spices are \nto a dish -- they can be hated or loved, but they tend to make \nthemselves evident. no, they are not all-important by any stretch of \nthe imagination.\n\nthere are so many people here who could be writing about this stuff \nbetter than me. i hope a few will chime in.\n\nwhat you wrote in your essay about the beating of the minor sixth? \nyou wrote that taking it as a consonance is therefore contrary to the \nwhole premise, beatless harmony, that underlies &quot;just intonation \ntheory&quot;. right? well, that&#39;s simply not the case, for any instance \nof &quot;just intonation theory&quot; that you&#39;ve mentioned so far.\n\n&gt; Anyway, rather than me playing a guessing \n&gt; game, why don&#39;t you just tell me your explanation of the tension in \nthat sort of \n&gt; augmented second, beyond the standard \n&gt; lowered-sixth-degree-and-raised-seventh-degree-needing-to-resolve \ntype of \n&gt; explanation?\n\n&quot;guessing game&quot;? -- seems like we had a serious communication blip \nthere. my apologies. anyway, it has to do with scalar gestalts and \nthe like, things that can coexist with &quot;just intonation theory&quot; (at \nleast in my mind). so why do i have to go into this now? :) :) :) \nsorry -- it&#39;s been quite a while since we left off! my apologies \nagain.\n\n&gt; With my use of the word &quot;alchemy&quot; I was not implying anything \nmetaphysical; it \n&gt; was intended as a kind of colorful reference to how various factors \n(e.g. traditional \n&gt; tonal harmonic structures) in a certain musical context  \ncan &quot;transform&quot; something \n&gt; we might expect, in theory, to be a consonance into a dissonance, \nand vice-versa. \n\ncertainly -- and i know of few ji composers who would deny their own \nmusic these effects -- remember, as david doty i think pointed out, \nsome of these folks regard consonance/dissonance as having *five* \ndifferent definitions! \n\n&gt;  perhaps this kind of thinking is too far off your \n&gt; &gt; star charts for you to consider right now, \n\nhmm . . . did you write that or did i?\n\n&gt; one of my points in that part of the article was to propose, in \npassing, looking \n&gt; beyond the consonance/dissonance dichotomy. But, yes, it would be \ninteresting to \n&gt; present certain microtonal intervals in different musical contexts \nand see how their \n&gt; effect changes, either within a &quot;consonance/dissonance&quot; scheme or \nin some \n&gt; broader sense. It was beyond the scope of this paper, for sure \n(but &quot;star charts&quot;?).\n\ndid i really write that? i can&#39;t figure out where i came up with \nthat . . . doubtless a failed witticism or something . . . i&#39;d really \nlike to flog myself for it now! (seriously, please accept my apology, \nno one should be subjected to anything that even *sounds* like that --\n sorry again.)\n\n&gt; Maybe it could be something worth studying in the future, though it \ndoes seem \n&gt; such a subjective matter, impossible to codify even if one wanted \nto.\n\nthe layers of subjectivity, of culture, that are buried in music of \ngreat worth, are immeasurable. i know of some staunch defenders \nof &quot;just intonation theory&quot; who hold to this most strongly, who feel \nit in their every musical bone. there is no contradition here.\n\nthus my weak attempts at recalling an argument many months fallow,\nbest regards,\npaul\n\n\n"

All you&#39;ve said so far was that he \ndemonstrated that a minor \n&gt; sixth was a harmonious interval.\n\nwas this addressed in the last e-mail.\n\nthen the rest of this -- whoa boy. my heart sinks at each one of the \nexchanges below. i clearly phrased each point very poorly and rudely \nand i&#39;m sorry. sadly, i was unable to get my thoughts across to you, \nas each statement had something potentially offensive in it and you, \nin all rightness, did not make the connections between them, to see \nwhat i was actually trying to say. it doesn&#39;t seem worth it at this \npoint if i can&#39;t communicate better.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; since you&#39;ve made statements about &quot;just intonation&quot; rather than \n&gt; &gt; about particular authors, \n&gt; \n&gt; How can you say this? Go back and look - I made statements about \nthe claims of \n&gt; several specific people.\n\nyes, but much of the time, you simply say &quot;just intonation&quot;, \nreferring to the &quot;entity&quot; (sorry if that&#39;s not a good word, hopefully \nyou can understand what i mean by that).\n\n&gt; &gt; one would assume you&#39;d gone through at \n&gt; &gt; least the majority of the relevant works in a major university \n&gt; &gt; library -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Tell me, do you think I spent three years writing my doctoral \nthesis *without* \n&gt; going to major university libraries and finding all the relevent \nworks I could, and \n&gt; when I couldn&#39;t find them ordering them through the mail? I&#39;ll do \nus both a favor \n&gt; and forget you even wrote that.\n\ni appreciate it!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; if not, wouldn&#39;t it be better to simply name and cite the \n&gt; &gt; items you&#39;re objecting to, to avoid inadvertantly offending \neveryone \n&gt; &gt; else who&#39;s used the term?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Did I not name and cite the items I was objecting to, thoroughly \nand methodically? \n\njulia, it seems that i lapsed into &quot;defender&quot; mode for &quot;just \nintonation&quot; -- whatever that entity is and whoever chooses to \nidentify with it. maybe i thought the cause was honorable at that \npoint in time. at this point it time, i will simply have to leave it \nit to the &quot;just intonationists&quot;.\n\n&gt; &gt; the middle paragraph on page 167 again invokes the &quot;straw man&quot;:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;. . . it would obviously be futile, even absurd, to try to avoid \nthe \n&gt; &gt; feared &#39;incorrectness&#39; of this majority of relationships by \n&gt; &gt; restricting oneself to simple pure triads or seventh chords in \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; music&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; which is not an argument against any contemporary just \nintonationist \n&gt; &gt; i can think of; and moreover, even restricting oneself in such a \n&gt; &gt; manner does not imply any restrictions whatsoever on the melodic \n&gt; &gt; intervals that may occur (q.v. the blackjack example again). \nsince \n&gt; &gt; melodic intervals are the primary focus of the second part of \nyour \n&gt; &gt; paper, there really seems to be a huge gap between the first part \nand \n&gt; &gt; the second part, such that one wonders what they&#39;re doing in the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; I see no connection (nor lack of connectedness) between these two \nthings. It seems \n&gt; like a big leap you are making. The second part of my paper is \nabout composing \n&gt; with microtones entirely independently of just intonation concerns, \nso why would JI \n&gt; restrictions or lack-of-them-in-melodic-intervals  be relevent \nthere?\n\ni can&#39;t recall my train of thought. this was an intense argument and \nmuch of it has faded from my mind. i think (?) the point i was making \nis that i really liked the second part of your paper, and it seemed \nto me in no way to rest upon anything you&#39;d established, or had \nclaimed to establish, in the first part of your paper . . .\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; sure, one can make \n&gt; &gt; concordances sound &quot;jarring&quot; and out-of-place in a context where \n&gt; &gt; dissonance is expected, but this only serves to demonstrate that \n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s a universally perceived difference in quality between the \n&gt; &gt; extremes of these categories. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t believe any dissonance is expected in the Bartok example I \ngave. (But try \n&gt; Mikrokosmos no. 65 from the same book, Vol. II, for another, maybe \neven better \n&gt; example of this, with harsh, rough, jarring open fifths and no \nharmonic \n&gt; expectations of any kind.) And fifths or octaves can \nsound &quot;jarring&quot; if you just sit \n&gt; and pound a bunch of them out violently on the piano, for that \nmatter. So musical \n&gt; context can include, aside from voice-leading and \nharmonic &quot;expectations,&quot; \n&gt; something as simple as dynamics and articulation. If there is \nsomething that is pure \n&gt; and perfect about the octave, well this is easily achievable, but \nit does depend on \n&gt; how this octave is treated by the composer. If someone hammers it \naway \n&gt; ruthlessly at a fortississimo dynamic, then that all of that purity \nor stability is going \n&gt; to go out the window. \n\nthe same even true about a single note! my point, perhaps, was that \nthe fifth or the octave is going to sound more like a single note \nthan most other intervals, even if a pounded fifth or octave sounds \nmore like a pounded single note . . . this &quot;singleness&quot; is perhaps \none of the five, or perhaps an additional, dimension of \nconsonance/dissonance that david doty was talking about . . .\n\n&gt; Maybe it seems like I am confusing issues now, confusing functional \nharmonic \n&gt; stability with the effects of dynamics and articulation. But this \nis exactly my point, \n&gt; that  psychoacoustic arguments about harmony that are *qualitative* \n(simple \n&gt; ratios=correct, irrational intervals=mistake) cannot lead us into \nthe music itself \n&gt; when they ignore the immeasurable influence of so many other \nfactors. And \n&gt; because of this I remain highly sceptical of the value - beyond its \nidiosyncratic \n&gt; application to the work of any one individual and his/her art - of \nany tuning dogma, \n&gt; *in our day and age*.\n\ni can&#39;t argue with you there. i think tuning theory should be useful, \nor at least interesting, but certainly not dogma. here, for example, \nthe dogma can get quite involved, with pauline for example having \nasserted that a 1 or 2 cent, more or less, deviation from just \nintervals is most desirable, but that a total lack of beating sounds \nartificial and harsh. actually, she sounds a lot less dogmatic now \nthan she did before . . .\n\n&gt; Gann writes that a 680-cent fifth sounds &quot;scary.&quot;\n\nif this is indeed an overarching assessment, made without context, \nthen this is certainly a piece of dogma i can&#39;t agree with. nor, i&#39;m \nsure, would many just intonation practitioners -- kraig grady in \nparticular loves to use this interval.\n\n&gt; This is not the same thing as saying that all intervals are the \nsame, \n&gt; it&#39;s just pointing out that all intervals are potential materials \nwith which to create a \n&gt; huge variety of kinds of great music. This seems so painfully \nobvious, in fact.\n\ni agree with you insofar as i can&#39;t symathize with any dogma that \nwould ban any given interval a priori.\n\n&gt; &gt; open fifths and octaves can \n&gt; &gt; sound &quot;incorrect&quot; when approched in parallel motion in some \nstyles; \n&gt; &gt; this in no way negates the fact that the perception of these \n&gt; &gt; intervals involves less neurological uncertainty than the \nperception \n&gt; &gt; of the &quot;richer&quot; intervals of tonal music -- it&#39;s just that the \nsudden \n&gt; &gt; reduction of uncertainty is damaging to the musical texture. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be curious to get a reading of someone&#39;s &quot;neurological \nuncertainty&quot; with my \n&gt; pounding octaves out on the piano at triple forte example.\n\nthe piano has some inharmonicity, but even so the &quot;neurological \nuncertainty&quot; (about the pitch of the sensation) would be lower than \nif you were to be pounding a twelve-tone chord, for example.\n\n&gt; But I&#39;m sure I sound \n&gt; very crude. \n\npounding on a piano? i do it all the time!\n\n:)\n\n\n&gt; (BTW, Here&#39;s your one person: David Doty, again, since I have his \nwebsite handy. \n&gt; &quot;Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the \nintervals can be \n&gt; represented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied \npreference for the \n&gt; smallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot; This is \nthe first \n&gt; statement in his definition of JI from his primer.\n\nyup, it&#39;s the *definition* for this particular system of *tuning*. \nyou can approximate any conceivable interval, i.e. fulfill any &quot;given \nmusical purpose&quot;, from the most consonant to the most dissonant, with \nan infinitude of different ratios. if you&#39;re a &quot;just intonationist&quot; \nin doty&#39;s sense, you&#39;ll choose with a strong preference for the \nsimpler of those ratios. so for a sharp dissonance of 63 cents, you&#39;d \noften choose to use 27:28 in this circumstance. it might fit better \nwith some other beatless intervals hanging about in the music, or it \nmight just be a matter of occult tradition -- either way, it would \naccord with &quot;just intonation&quot; tuning principles.\n\nok, so this statement of doty&#39;s, is it problematical in some way? \nsorry, i&#39;ve again lost the train . . .\n\n&gt; &gt; if taken to its extreme, this &quot;just intonation&quot; view would allow \nonly \n&gt; &gt; the very simplest and least ambiguous interval, the 1/1, to ever \n&gt; &gt; occur as a verticality in music (while of course saying nothing \nabout \n&gt; &gt; disallowing any conceivable melodic/horizontal intervals). and \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; can one find examples of such an aesthetic? ironically enough, in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; second part of your paper!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re definitely going to need to explain that one. \n\nyou have some single-voice pieces in the second part of your paper, \ndon&#39;t you?\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may not undestand why one would use JI if one doesn&#39;t believe \nin \n&gt; &gt; its basic premise, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but that&#39;s none of my business.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; then why claim that some just intonation composers, any in fact \nthat \n&gt; &gt; use &quot;interesting&quot; (for you) sonorities or intervals, are \nviolating \n&gt; &gt; the basic premise of just intonation? without providing a single \n&gt; &gt; example of a composer who writes music consistent with the basic \n&gt; &gt; premise of just intonation as you see it? if you truly felt that \nit&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; none of your business, you wouldn&#39;t have made this claim. \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re mixing up issues. I didn&#39;t claim in my paper that Sims, \nStahnke, Johnston \n&gt; and Harrison don&#39;t *believe* in the basic premise of JI. I *did* \nclaim that these \n&gt; four composers seem, in certain pieces, to be &quot;taking fundamental \nliberties with \n&gt; the just intonation model, admittedly or not,&quot; and that is a \ndifferent thing.\n\n&quot;taking fundamental liberties with&quot; sure sounds like &quot;violating the \nbasic premise of&quot;. so what&#39;s wrong with what i wrote above? what did \ni mix up?\n\n&gt; I \n&gt; suppose one could say that if a composer *intentionally* takes \nliberties with the JI \n&gt; model, as Stahnke has done in pieces like &quot;Partch Harp,&quot; in which \nhe juxtaposes \n&gt; two conflicting just tunings, that this seems to imply he/she must \nnot believe in its \n&gt; basic premise. But that would be jumping to conclusions. \n\nagreed!\n&gt; \n&gt; Notice, too, the difference between my &quot;taking liberties&quot; language \nand your \n&gt; &quot;violating&quot; memory of what I wrote. Taking liberties is what real \nartists often need \n&gt; to do, in my opinion.\n\ni guess i speak a different language then you. to me these terms mean \npretty much the same thing. in your last sentence above, you&#39;ve spun \nthem with a different connotation than the one i was originally \nthinking of, but that must reflect how my words sounded to you. ah, \nthe joys of communicating with paul. it ain&#39;t always easy, but it can \nbe done. again, my sincerest apologies.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; did you run your &quot;taken \n&gt; &gt; fundamental liberties with the just intonation model&quot; claim by \nany of \n&gt; &gt; the composers you accuse of doing so, to see how they would \nrespond, \n&gt; &gt; before putting such a statement in print? i doubt it -- either \nway, \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s now irrevocably &quot;your business&quot;!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; I accused no one. I would never &quot;accuse&quot; a composer of something \nhe/she had \n&gt; composed. I do make the claim you&#39;ve quoted, but there was no  \naccusatory tone.\n\nok, can we substitute a better word for &quot;accuse&quot;, then? clearly we \nhave some word issues -- i hope this can be amusing at the same time \nthat it&#39;s difficult :)\n \n&gt; In fact, the main purpose of the section you are referring to (p170-\n171) was to \n&gt; praise the some of the music of these four people and to admit that \nsome good \n&gt; music has come out if it, despite the theory (as well as to \nconclude by stating once \n&gt; again my belief that one could just as well get the funky intervals \ndirectly, without \n&gt; all the theory). I don&#39;t believe I needed their permission to write \nthis, as it is \n&gt; understood clearly to be *my* view of things. \n\nok -- and i&#39;m going to retire from my attempts to preemptively get \noffended on behalf of this or that just intonationist out there. i \nhope that&#39;s ok with you :)\n\n&gt; And I knew that Ezra (a friend) would hate what I wrote \n&gt; there. On the other hand, he already knows my views; he knows that \nI don&#39;t share \n&gt; his theory but do admire his music.\n\nok, you and i also don&#39;t share identical views (though they have many \nsimilarities), and we certainly don&#39;t use words in the same way . . . \nso i&#39;m ready to call it done on this, and leave it to the just \nintonation folks to pick it up if they wish . . . the most difficult \nthink in the world already is talking about music, but this is \nridiculous!\n\n:) :) :)\n\ncheers to a bright musical future,\npaul\n\n\n"

(Actually, \n&gt; according to Partch, maybe it would be the unison?) Anyway, I never claimed that \n&gt; the JI composers I cited in the essay maximize the octave in their music. Though I \n&gt; have heard plenty of JI music that seems to be &quot;maximizing&quot; partials 1-7 or 1-9. I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to get into that, though. \n&gt; \n&gt; (BTW, Here&#39;s your one person: David Doty, again, since I have his website handy. \n&gt; &quot;Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can be \n&gt; represented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied preference for the \n&gt; smallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot; This is the first \n&gt; statement in his definition of JI from his primer. And, further down: &quot;The \n&gt; simple-ratio intervals upon which Just Intonation is based ...are what the human \n&gt; auditory system recognizes as consonance, if it ever has the opportunity to hear \n&gt; them in a musical context.&quot; I&#39;m just sitting at my computer right at this moment; it \n&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t be too hard to find more.)\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n\nThank you for your lucid remarks.\n\nWhat is the URL for David Doty&#39;s website?\n\nAlso, if you play a C octave as &quot;the most perfect harmonic structure&quot; as you say\n&quot;of just intonation,&quot; at least in that scale, would adding an F note in that octave,\nas you play it, form for you, a consonant or dissonant chord?  And what do you call the F\nnote relative to the C octave, as described?  Would you call it a harmonic chord?\n\nThank you for your lucid remarks.\n\nAnd thanks, in advance,\n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More\nhttp://faith.yahoo.com\n\n"

One can even \n&gt; see this fact in the string section, as the players don&#39;t bow at the same \n&gt; instant, nor the same length. Even their bow lengths and style vary between \n&gt; instruments.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand &quot;cycles&quot; behave this way and wonder WHY an &quot;orchestra\n&gt; &gt; sounds so nice&quot; because of it?\n&gt; \n&gt; I once had a top-octave tone generator from Paia Electronics in OK that \n&gt; produced an chromatic octave of JI notes locked in phase. And it sounded very \n&gt; unnatural! The major 3rds had a reedy tone besides, unwanted in most music.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you also elaborate on WHY &quot;As octaves in phase in the midrange make \n&gt; &gt; the higher note sound very-much louder&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, I no longr have Steven Irwin&#39;s book on electroic organ stops \n&gt; that discussed this issue. But I can hear it with my ears. That&#39;s one reason \n&gt; I split the keyboards at Middle C. Also to have more stop-use flexibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; Low-end and high-end in-phase octaves likewise make the higher note sound \n&gt; much louder theoretically. But our ears are less sensitve to it than in the \n&gt; midrange. But having all octaves out of phase sound better. That&#39;s one \n&gt; argument kit-organ builders had for having each octave as separate tone \n&gt; generators. They even had each note within an octave separate for the \n&gt; ultimate in pipe-organ realism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pauline\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More\nhttp://faith.yahoo.com\n\n"

If anybody has a great idea, I \nwould certainly be interested in hearing it.   I am not sure what &quot;special \nemphasis&#39; means in this context. \nThanks, \nEd Foote \n\n\n&gt;&gt;I. I need a particular scale that stresses (gives special emphasis to the\n\n9th minor [i.e. C-Db] and 7th major [C-H] and also 4th and tritonos [4th+].\n\n\nII. I don&#39;t know if it has never exclusively been thought for a piano, I&#39;d\n\nlike that scales from C to H would not be &quot;parallele&quot;, that is with a\n\nfrequency always doubled, but, between C and the next, there would always be\n\na constant being out of tune, with an excess of a bit less of 1/4 tone.\n\n\nMy intention is to prepare a piano with particular values of frequency\n\nalready given, i.e. betweeen the former note [A0] and the latter [C8] here\n\nwould not be more than a tone (considering the possible breaking of the\n\nstrings).&lt;&lt;\n\n"

So in a minor 7th chord C-\nE-Bb comes \n&gt; from the left side and G from the right. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Positif (Choir) Principal 8&#39; all comes from the right side. \nProbably on \n&gt; the theory a Positif was a small portable organ set at a 90-degree \nangle to \n&gt; the main organ, playable with the right hand. Or becasue the \nRuckpositif was \n&gt; behind the organist&#39;s back on a rail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pauline\n\n\n***I love writing for organ, but recently I was *shocked* to find \nthat the organ has virtually *no* possibility for crescendo and \ndiminuendo other than *adding overtones* by bigger mixes in the \nstops!  I asked the organist if it weren&#39;t possible to change the \ndynamics somewhat with a pedal for the Swell rank.  (I remembered \nthat from my rather abbreviated organ lessons..)  He said, yes, but \nonly on *that* particular rank... and even that was not so effective.\n\nSo, basically *all dynamics* are involved with this adding of \npartials, which is why this is such a significant topic.  And even \nthen, everything is *latticed*; there is really no smooth crescendo \nor diminuendo, everything is &quot;on or off!&quot;  And having more than one \ndynamic in different manuals in a piece going on simultaneously *is* \npossible, but can be rather involved to accomplish, and again \n*latticed.*\n\nSo the way these *mixtures* are put together are absolutely crucial \nto the final sound.  Sounds to me as though Pauline really *likes* \nsome of the inconsistencies of slight mistuning.  More like the &quot;real \nworld...&quot;  It&#39;s fascinating to think about the clash or contrast \nbetween the *natural* overtones of the pipes and the inherent tuning, \nbe it 12-equal, Werckmeister, or whatever...\n\nJ. Pehrson\n\n\n\n"

The standard Western triad involves three notes: a root, a perfect fifth above it, and a note in between that forms the third of the chord. The terms root, third, and fifth derive from their sequence in the scale. The chord is either major or minor depending on whether it has a third that is, respectively, two whole steps or one whole step and one half step. This, again, is all relating to standard 12tet Western harmony. You should also note that the root, major third and perfect fifth form the first triad that appears in the natural harmonic overtone series.\n\nSo if the root is C, the third is either E or E-flat, and the fifth is G. If you were to have C and F, they form a perfect fourth. If you were to have those as two components of a triad, it would be F on the bottom and C as the fifth, and then either A or A-flat as the third.\n\nYou might want to check out an elementary (Western) music theory book from a library, as all of this, including inversions, 7th chords, etc. would be explained.\n\nJon\n\n\n"

They don&#39;t quite make it, =\r\nbut \n&gt; the sound is better than ET.\n\nThat means that if you play C, then E,=\r\n then release C, the E goes up\nto the pipe natural frequency!!\n\nThe idea th=\r\nat near-just pipe organ pair can enter lock phase mode to\nplay in JI is mor=\r\ne than interresting! It is downright fascinating.\nThis means that the organ=\r\n can not be considered as a fixed tuning\ninstrument, but, to a certain exte=\r\nnd as an adaptative one. So there\ncould be a pitch drift between a pipe sou=\r\nnding alone and a pipe\nsounding at a near just interval. Is it possible to =\r\nprovide an sound\nexample of this phenomena?\n\n&gt; Those who seek to have their=\r\n just intonation 100% perfect\n&gt; theoretically, create something unnatural, =\r\nas it&#39;s not found in\n&gt; nature for harmonic-partials aboee the 3rd one. \n\nTh=\r\ne perfection is not measurable, but with enough time to settle (and\nenough =\r\nskill from the performers) a capella ensemble can sign nearly\nperfect triad=\r\ns, i.e. as perfect as can be measured (with the crude\nmeans I have at hand)=\r\n, let say within one or two cents, and it\ncertainly not sound unnatural.\nI =\r\nsuspect that reed wind ensemble can do even better that. \n\n&gt; And an organ s=\r\ntop book I had listed many uncertainties organ pipes\nare\n&gt; subject to which=\r\n prevents their harmonic spectrum from bein\nperfectly\n&gt; in tune for any len=\r\ngth of time, if at all.\n\nI have been involved in some harsh &quot;uncertainty pr=\r\ninciple&quot; discussion\non this NG as an advocate of intrincics limitation of p=\r\nitch\nmeasurement. Nevertheless,the incertainty on measurement does not\ninvo=\r\nlve AT ALL incertainty on the process under mesurement. I think\nthat after =\r\nthe air flow settle in the pipes, the tone should be fairly\nstable, as shou=\r\nld be any resonant system. What make you think that the\ntone of many pipes =\r\nsingning together is not stable? \n\nThe explanation of why organ tuning syst=\r\nematically deviate from just\nhas perhaps to do with the &quot;warmth&quot; given by t=\r\nhe beat of upper\nfrequencie that gives a vibrato-like quality that make the=\r\nm more like\nhuman voice.\n\nI am not sure if your acceptance of the term &quot;in =\r\nphase&quot; is in phase\n:-) with the common (physical) acceptance of the term, s=\r\no I am not\nsure to understand what your are talking about. Let say that we =\r\nhave N\nsources providing pure sine:\n\n    S1 =3D A * sin (( omega * t ) + PH=\r\nI1)\n    S2 =3D A * sin (( omega * t ) + PHI2)\n\t.....\n    SN =3D A * sin (( =\r\nomega * t ) + PHIN)\n\nThey are in phase if PHI1 =3D PHI2 ....=3D PHIN. If al=\r\nl sources are\nin phase the overall amplitude goes as N while if the phases =\r\nare\nrandom, the overall amplitude goes (statistically) as square root of\nN.=\r\n So, as you stated, if many pipes in unison are in phase, yes they\nsound lo=\r\nuder.\n\nIt worth to be noted that the notion of &quot;being in phase&quot; makes sense=\r\n\nonly if the sources separation is much smaller than the wavelenth. So\nthis=\r\n may makes sense for organ pipes that are near to each other (as\nyour organ=\r\n building/tuning hand-on experience demonstrates).\nThis does not make sense=\r\n for violins in an orchestra because their\ndistance to each other is of the=\r\n order of magnitude of wavelength or\nbigger. Further any violin is so much =\r\ndifferent from any other violin\nin term of tone and phase, that even if the=\r\ny where stacked, there\nwould probably be no such thing as significant acous=\r\ntical coupling.\nThe warmth of string ensemble is due to the clustering of i=\r\nnstrument\nwith slighlty different tones and slighly different pitch due to\n=\r\ndifferent vibrato speed, width and phase. \n\nI think that your understanding=\r\n of &quot;phase&quot; is much broader than the\nphysics acceptance and include pitch a=\r\nnd tone. Am I correct?\n\nIn fact when talking about &quot;physical&quot; phase, the hu=\r\nman ear is\n(nearly) totally insensitive to phase on stable signal. Phase is=\r\n\npercepually important in the attack an decay of sound, but not on\nstable p=\r\nart.\n\nWhen there are multiple similar sources, we may be sensitives to some=\r\n\neffects of the phase, but not to the phase by itself. \n\nyours truly\n\nFran=\r\n=E7ois Laferri=E8re\n\n\n\n"

I asked the organist if it weren&#39;t possible to change the \n&gt; dynamics somewhat with a pedal for the Swell rank.  (I remembered \n&gt; that from my rather abbreviated organ lessons..)  He said, yes, but \n&gt; only on *that* particular rank... and even that was not so \neffective.\n\nFirst, let&#39;s get the terminology straight.  A &quot;rank&quot; is a set of \npipes (one assigned to each key of one of the &quot;manuals&quot; or keyboards) \nhaving a single timbre; each rank generally has its own on/off \ncontroller, called a &quot;stop.&quot;  A &quot;division&quot; (e.g., swell, great, and \npedal divisions) consists of one or (usually) more ranks of pipes \nplaced on a wind chest and assigned to be controlled (or played) from \na specific manual (having the same name as the division) or the \npedals.\n\nThe swell division gets its name from the fact that its pipes are in \nan enclosure have a set of shutters (something on the order of \nvertical blinds) in front that are controlled by a &quot;swell pedal&quot; to \nreduce the volume of sound by partial or complete closing.  Most \norgans built in the 20th century also have the great, pedal, and \nadditional divisions similarly enclosed separately from the swell \ndivision and operated by a second expression pedal.  There is also \nusually a &quot;crescendo pedal&quot; that can control the volume of all of the \ndivisions simultaneously by adding stops one at a time in a fixed \norder.\n\nHowever, this is not the whole story.  What I have described above is \ncharacteristic of a &quot;romantic organ&quot;, one designed and built \nprimarily for the requirements of 19th-century organ music.  More \nsuitable for the works of J. S. Bach and earlier composers is the \nclassic-voiced organ which, in addition to lacking any sort of swell-\nbox with shutters, has the pipes voiced so that the tone has a more \nabrupt (almost percussive) attack (or &quot;chiff&quot;), which makes the \nattack of the romantic organ sound mushy by comparison.\n\nThe classic and romantic organs therefore have distinctly different \nsounds, so you would almost have to consider them different \ninstruments, as different as, say, an acoustic and an electric guitar.\n\n--George\n\n\n"

Organ pipes as well rise somewhat in pitch as the pipe speaks, as th=\r\ne \nair pressure rises.\n\n\n&gt; The idea that near-just pipe organ pair can ente=\r\nr lock phase mode to\n&gt; play in JI is more than interresting! It is downrigh=\r\nt fascinating.\n&gt; Is it possible to provide an sound\n&gt; example of this pheno=\r\nmena?\n\nThe natural pitch the pipe rises to when played alone referred to wa=\r\ns ET. not \nJI. I don&#39;t have access to a pipe organ right now. And no mike f=\r\nor my \nrecorder either.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The perfection is not measurable, but with en=\r\nough time to settle a capella \n&gt; ensemble can sign nearly\n&gt; perfect triads,=\r\n i.e. as perfect as can be measured , let say within one or \n&gt; two cents, a=\r\nnd it certainly not sound unnatural.\n&gt; \nMy JT scale I posted here is +/- 1-=\r\n2 cents off the theoretical value. When I \nrefer to 100%, I mean exactly th=\r\nat as produced electronically. It does sound \nunnatural!\n\nOne of the compla=\r\nints pipe organists have had with analog electronic organs \nwas their locke=\r\nd-in-phase notes. As pipe-organ pipes don&#39;t speak in phase \nwith other note=\r\ns except randomly and momnetarily.\n \n&gt; I think\n&gt; that after the air flow se=\r\nttle in the pipes, the tone should be fairly\n&gt; stable, as should be any res=\r\nonant system. What make you think that the\n&gt; tone of many pipes singning to=\r\ngether is not stable? \n\nThey are ssas stable as wind instruments. Whose pla=\r\nyers don&#39;t play every note \nperfectly. Every time a Principal note or chord=\r\n is repeated in succession, it \nsoundis different each time. As the attack,=\r\n decay and harmonic structure \nvaries.\n\n&gt; The explanation of why organ tuni=\r\nng systematically deviate from just\n&gt; has perhaps to do with the &quot;warmth&quot; g=\r\niven by the beat of upper\n&gt; frequencie that gives a vibrato-like quality th=\r\nat make them more like\n&gt; human voice.\n\nSome harmonics, perhaps better calle=\r\nd enharmonics, in some stops  like \nstrings or reeds beat with each other a=\r\nnd with the harmonic partials. This \nmay become very noticeable in the very=\r\n low Pedal pitches.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure if your acceptance of the term &quot;in =\r\nphase&quot; is in phase\n&gt; :-) with the common (physical) acceptance of the term,=\r\n\n\nBy in phase I mean hwhen all possible harmonics and their fundamental ton=\r\nes \nsound perfectly together beatless when produced electronically. Musical=\r\n tone \nproduced acoustically aren&#39;t that accurate.\n\n So, as you stated, if =\r\nmany pipes in unison are in phase, yes they&gt; \n&gt; sound louder.\n\nI didn&#39;t say=\r\n any notes, but octaves. and on analog electronic organs, not \npipe organs.=\r\n. The higher note in such octaves in midrange do sound louder. \nOrgan books=\r\n say so,   and ia can hear it myself. That&#39;s one reason why I \nsplit my key=\r\nboard tone generators between Tenor B and Middle C.\n\n&gt; The warmth of string=\r\n ensemble is due to the clustering of instrument\n&gt; with slighlty different =\r\ntones and slighly different pitch due to\n&gt; different vibrato speed, width a=\r\nnd phase. \n\nThat&#39;s essentially what I&#39;ve been saying. Vioolinists don&#39;t pla=\r\ny in phase, as \ntheir bows aren&#39;t in exact moving order. I think my use to =\r\nthe term &quot;in \nphase&quot; is what musical people and music physicists mean. Elec=\r\ntroniclly \nproduced sound in phase sounds much differenen from the same sou=\r\nnd produced \nacoustically not in perfect phase.

These pieces begin from \nthe raga format, but evolve according to the in-the-moment \nemotional pulse and interplay.  Since the Oct.26th concert \ncoincides with the huge anti-war rally in Washington D.C., \nwe would like to dedicate it and the Oct.23rd one as well\nto the principle of working to create peace through non-violent \ncooperation.  We would agree with one wise soul who \nhas said that war is a failure of the imagination.\n\nBoth Lawrence and Lisa have been improvising and \ncomposing for over 30 years. Lawrence has recorded \nalmost 2000 pieces of distinctive piano explorations, the\nhallmark of his repertoire.  He is also the director of the \nPlanet Tree Music Festival in London which has presented \nnew and exciting musical programs since 1996.\n\nLisa Sangita who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area \nspecializes in playing her electric sarod (a one-of-a-kind \nadaptation of the traditional classical Indian sarod)\nin unusual contexts, but has found the greatest satisfaction \nin the combination of sarod with chordal instruments.  \nShe studied with maestro Ali Akbar Khan for more than \n15 years.  The timbres of sarod and piano are quite similar, \nbut they differ widely in the way they express themselves \n(piano being a very harmonic instrument and sarod being \nmore strictly melodic).   Together they create a whole \nnew musical language.\n                                                                   \n&quot;. contemplative... capable of transporting listeners into hypnotic reveries. \nrife with ingenious improvisations and ever-mounting creative energy. \na sonic mix that promises enthralling melodies and rapturous rhythms.&quot;    \n          Derk Richardson     The East Bay Express\n                   =====\nhttp://www.planettree.org/\nhttp://www.lisamoskow.com\nhttp://home.attbi.com/~mihman/lisa/\n\n\r\n--Boundary_(ID_HYaH3y7hqyPBXii8lh9YnQ)\r\nContent-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-transfer-encoding: 7BIT\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2715.400&quot; name=GENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Friends of mine are in NYC for concerts. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Lisa Sangita plays electric sarod, an electric \nversion of&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;the North Indian fretless lute, and Lawrence Ball plays \n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;acoustic piano.

I would be interested in knowing if this \nis a &quot;generalized&quot; keyboard? Is there a plan to release a version with \nmore than 5 octaves?\n\nDo you know what the starting price is going to be? Also, is it \nsomething that will just be a MIDI controller, or will it have its own \nsynth?\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n\n"

Do \nthey seem to have a bad reaction to &quot;fingering&quot; a pitch while hearing a \ndifferent (unexpected) pitch?\n\nWhat sorts of controls are built into the patches you have designed for \nthe instrument? I am curious about how you would handle such things as \n&quot;embouchure&quot; (which on a real instrument would effect the pitch of the \nnote)? I would imagine that the natural tendency of the performer would \nbe to apply more &quot;embouchure&quot; to get the pitch that they expect (or am I \nwrong here...).\n\nThank,\n\nMike\n\n\n"

The\nonly downside is programming.\n\nI also saw on the site some custom job with a separate ztar\nkeyboard/fretboard. That gave me the idea for what I call the &#39;Stick&#39; which\nis a long fretboard with say 24/36 frets on it just like the ztar is now. At\nthe bottom are some controls, and somewhere would be a midi port or similar\nfor programming etc, or the programming is done &#39;on board&#39; - much better\nidea. Room for batteries in behind I suppose, or power can come from the\nmidi cable.\n\nYou play it like a viol or &#39;cello, but with one big difference - both hands\ncan be used for tapping on the velocity sensitive keys, which I suppose\ncould also respond to aftertouch.\n\nrubbish idea or brilliant - ?\n\nMark G\n\n\n\n"

The standard Western triad involves three notes: a root, a perfect fifth\n&gt; above it, and a note in between that forms the third of the chord. The terms root,\n&gt; third, and fifth derive from their sequence in the scale. The chord is either major or\n&gt; minor depending on whether it has a third that is, respectively, two whole steps or one\n&gt; whole step and one half step. This, again, is all relating to standard 12tet Western\n&gt; harmony. You should also note that the root, major third and perfect fifth form the\n&gt; first triad that appears in the natural harmonic overtone series.\n&gt; \n&gt; So if the root is C, the third is either E or E-flat, and the fifth is G. If you were\n&gt; to have C and F, they form a perfect fourth. If you were to have those as two\n&gt; components of a triad, it would be F on the bottom and C as the fifth, and then either\n&gt; A or A-flat as the third.\n&gt; \n&gt; You might want to check out an elementary (Western) music theory book from a library,\n&gt; as all of this, including inversions, 7th chords, etc. would be explained.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nHi, Jon.  Why thank you very much for your lucid explanation.  It makes perfect sense to\nme now, although I will have other questions as I go along in my research.  Charles Lucy\nhas put his URL on, and I went to :\n\nhttp://www.lucytune.com/colour_and_mapping/clock_face.html\n\nI note he has two distinct clock faces: his first clock face is 12 Tone Equal Temperment,\nwhich I guess is what you are referring to above as Western music theory?  Is that\ncorrect?\n\nHis second clock face is what he calls: Lucy Tuning Intervals or Naturals?\n\nIn what sense are the latter &quot;Naturals&quot; and the &quot;Western&quot; are not natural?\n\nI thank you for your suggestion that I read an elementary book.  However, I am not after\nan elementary understanding.  I look at Charles Lucy&#39;s Charts, and they are not\nelementary nor do I find any of this elementary, but complex.  Not that that scares\nme from investigating it.  \n\nI guess what I am after now: can you explain to me if there IS such a thing as\n&quot;Natural&quot; scales?  And &quot;Natural&quot; chords?  Or, are they, like words, the creation\nof the mind?  You know, as pointed out by many authors such as Guy Murchie in Music of\nthe Spheres, that there are &quot;Natural&quot; shapes in Nature: six-sided hexagonal gems like\nemeralds and eight-sided pyramidal gems like diamonds.  So: are their such &quot;Natural&quot;\nshapes in scales and chords in Nature?  Or, are they creatings of minds?\n\nThanks in advance. \n\nArnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

It should be available by summertime.\n\n&gt; Could your give a link to a reference for the keyboard layout (I am not \n&gt; familiar with Sieman Terpstra)? \n\nSiem does not have a web site and lives in Amsterdam in Nederland.  He has \nwritten for 1/1 and other tuning oriented periodicals.\n\nI would be interested in knowing if this &gt; \n&gt; is a &quot;generalized&quot; keyboard? \n\nYes.\n\nIs there a plan to release a version with &gt; more than 5 octaves?\n&gt; \n\nIt would be diminishing returns: it would be physically too large, harder to \ntransport, harder to move around, and even with an arc, it would destroy the \nsymmetry offered by Siem&#39;s design.  Besides, you could use a macro (even a \npedal) to switch everything an octave lower or higher.\n\n\n&gt; Do you know what the starting price is going to be? \n\nI hope the starting price will be under $2,000 US.\n\n\nAlso, is it &gt; \n&gt; something that will just be a MIDI controller, or will it have its own \n&gt; synth?\n\nIt will not have its own synth.  Any synth compatible with SCALA will work.  \nAlso, you won&#39;t need a synth because it can be plugged directly into the \ncomputer and work with SCALA in that manner (though the choice of timbres is \nmore limited).\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n\nYou most welcome.  Johnny Reinhard\n\np.s.

I note he has two distinct clock faces: his \n&gt; first clock face is 12 Tone Equal Temperment, which I guess \n&gt; is what you are referring to above as Western music theory?\n&gt; Is that correct?\n\nWithout going back to his site to check, I&#39;d reservedly say yes.\n\n&gt; His second clock face is what he calls: Lucy Tuning Intervals or \n&gt; Naturals? In what sense are the latter &quot;Naturals&quot; and the \n&gt; &quot;Western&quot; are not natural?\n\nBefore we go too much further, note the following:\n\n1. For explanations of LucyTuning (and related materials, with Galaxy-wide Copyrights or whatever) you should ask Mr. Lucy himself. They are his theories.\n\n2. The term &quot;natural&quot;, in all uses but especially (for us) in music, is layered with many meanings. I *think* I know what you are asking, but using the term &quot;natural&quot; will lead you into a *lot* of confusion.\n\nI will defer to the many more knowledgeable people on the tuning list, but I&#39;ll try to at least point you in the right direction.\n\n&gt; I thank you for your suggestion that I read an elementary book.  \n&gt; However, I am not after an elementary understanding.\n\nI am not meaning for you to have _only_ an elementary understanding, but if you are confused over the most basic elements of Western music, and then going out from there, you will need to instruct yourself in those basics. I, myself, may one day want to understand, deeply, quantum physics. If so, I better learn the mathematical and physical tenets and basics of those disciplines (or other suitable ones) before simply casting myself in the deep end.\n\n&gt; I guess what I am after now: can you explain to me if there IS \n&gt; such a thing as &quot;Natural&quot; scales?  And &quot;Natural&quot; chords?\n\nI am going to stop you right there and give what I *think* is what you are after: I _believe_ you are looking to the natural frequency vibrations of the harmonic series, sometimes (frequently) referred to as the harmonic series. These are the frequencies that start with a root, produce an octave above that, then the perfect fifth, another octave, a major third, etc. These frequencies vibrate in a relationship to each other: 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc.\n\nAgain, there are physio-acoustic wizards here on the list (Paul Erlich, to name one) who can explain this not only more correctly and exactly but also with proper terminology.\n\nThat said, there is one branch of music/tuning that is a direct outgrowth of the natural harmonic series. This one large branch is known as Just Intonation, and it is practiced - by composers and performers - in a number of different ways. An introduction to this subject (indeed, the first chapter from the &quot;Just Intonation Primer&quot;,  by David Doty) can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/primer2.html\n\n&gt; You know, as pointed out by many authors such as Guy Murchie in \n&gt; Music of the Spheres, that there are &quot;Natural&quot; shapes in Nature: \n&gt; six-sided hexagonal gems like emeralds and eight-sided pyramidal \n&gt; gems like diamonds.  So: are their such &quot;Natural&quot;\n&gt; shapes in scales and chords in Nature?  Or, are they creatings of \n&gt; minds?\n\nYes. And no.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

We stay on, emphasise, repeat, w=\r\nea=3D\r\nve patterns around, these vadi and samvadi long enough to keep away from &#39;=\r\nSa=3D\r\n&#39; for quite a long time. Does this result in\n&#39;extended reference&#39;/dynamic =\r\ntonic drift?\n\nThank you all in advance and in anticipation,\nHaresh.\n\n------=\r\n--  original messages  -------------------------------------- \nFrom:  &quot;kiko=\r\nmayorga&quot; &lt;kikomayorga@y...&gt; \nDate:  Sun Oct 13, 2002  10:59 pm\ni started bu=\r\nilding structures in reaktor3, \nwhich periodically multiplied the reference=\r\n frequency of a chord by \na simple just ratio (3/2 , 4/3 , 9/8) and took th=\r\ne result as the new \nreference. -obviously i introduced an &quot;autooctaver&quot; wh=\r\nich ensured \nthat the reference would not get out of a desired range.-\n\nThe=\r\n chords were made up of randomly selected harmonics of the \ndynamic referen=\r\nce frequency, which i started to call &quot;dynamic \ntonic&quot;. I have the impressi=\r\non that when listening to such a \nstructure, one starts expecting further m=\r\nodulations, and looses the \nneed of remainig around a static tonality.\n----=\r\n--------------------\nFrom:  &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; \nDate:  Sun Oct 13,=\r\n 2002  11:40 pm\n\nThat would certainly be my impression. Both with JI and va=\r\nrious ETs and tem=3D\r\nperments, I find that many times I lose that wanting to home back in on on=\r\ne =3D\r\ntonic.\n-------------------------\nFrom:  Mats =D6ljare &lt;oljare@h...&gt; \nDate:=\r\n  Sun Oct 13, 2002  11:40 pm\nI don&#39;t think that there is much to theorize a=\r\nbout this-it&#39;s a\npsychological issue, related to the subjective effects of =\r\nmovement and\n&quot;tension&quot;.\n---------------------------\nFrom:  &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a..=\r\n.&gt; \nDate:  Mon Oct 14, 2002  1:34 am\n\none thing that i thought of right awa=\r\ny from Kiko&#39;s description\nis &quot;commatic drift&quot; -- when singers sing in stric=\r\nt JI and the\nfact that the 2nd degree of the diatonic scale has to be tuned=\r\n\none way to be consonant with the II chord and another way\n(a syntonic comm=\r\na higher) to be consonant with the V chord.\n------------------------------\n=\r\nFrom:  &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; \nDate:  Tue Oct 15, 200=\r\n2  6:20 pm\nhate to be a stickler but what you&#39;re describing here is a comma=\r\ntic \nshift, not commatic drift. commatic drift is what would happen if you =\r\n\ntried to use only one tuning for the 2nd degree, say if it were a \nmelody =\r\nnote holding over from the ii chord to the V chord, but tuned \nthe other de=\r\ngrees to form ji chords with it. this would result in the \ntonic itself dri=\r\nfting, usually downward by several commas over the \ncourse of a typical com=\r\nposition.\n-----------------------------\nFrom:  &quot;kikomayorga&quot; &lt;kikomayorga@y=\r\n...&gt; \nDate:  Wed Oct 16, 2002  10:03 pm\n\nYeah... with JI one finds no limit=\r\ns when dinamically travelling \nthrough new harmonic spaces.. \nI remember ha=\r\nving made some long recordings which made harmonic sense \nwhen listened lin=\r\nearly, but were surprisingly out of tune when \nreproduced as randomly order=\r\ned sections. There are great \npossibilities when playing around with dynami=\r\nc reference, modulations \nand short time memory! \n-------------------------=\r\n------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Schulter&quot; &lt;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=1325768\r\n\r\nHello, there, everyone, and how one analyzes 3:4:6 depends a great\ndeal upon what period or style of Western European or other theory one\nis focusing on.\n\nTo me, 3:4:6 is a variation on the more conclusive 2:3:4, with the\nlatter arrangement (outer 2:4 octave, 2:3 fifth below, 3:4 fourth\nabove) as a complete stable sonority in 13th-14th century music of\nWestern Europe.\n\nAs one theorist around 1300 explains, in 2:3:4 the intervals follow a\n&quot;natural series&quot; of numbers 2-3-4, with the 2:3 fifth &quot;preceding&quot; the\nmore complex 3:4 fourth.\n\nInterestingly, this passage was written about three centuries before\nthe discovery of the harmonic series, or of the way a vibrating string\nin effect subdivides itself to produce partials such as the 2:1 octave\nand 3:1 twelfth (fifth plus octave).\n\nIn the era around 1300, a theorist named Johannes de Grocheio\ndescribes a complete 2:3:4 sonority as manifesting _trina harmoniae\nperfectio_, the &quot;threefold perfection of harmony,&quot; since it includes\nall three simple stable consonances: the 2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth, and\n4:3 fourth.\n\nThis phrase leads to the modern English term &quot;trine&quot; for a complete\n2:3:4 sonority; in Gothic and neo-medieval styles, it defines the\nstandard of full stable harmony, and the ideal resolution for unstable\nsonorities.\n\nTheorists around 1300 also note that 2:3:4 is smoother than 3:4:6,\nwith the 3:4 fourth below the 4:6 or 2:3 fourth. Either is regarded by\nJacobus of Liege (c. 1325) as perfectly concordant, but with the first\nform generally preferable.\n\nThis preference, however, may vary: around 1030, Guido d&#39;Arezzo in his\n_Micrologus_ prefers the 3:4 fourth to the 2:3 fifth as a basic\ninterval, and advocates the placement of the fourth below the fifth in\na technique of three-voice singing which involves a series of 3:4:6\nsonorities.\n\nIf we want a name for the 3:4:6 reflecting later stylistic trends\naround the 13th century, we could call it a &quot;converse trine,&quot; since\nthe intervals are said to be arranged &quot;conversely&quot; (_e converso_) from\nthe more conclusive 2:3:4 sonority with the fifth below the fourth.\n\nA standard Gothic Pythagorean tuning, generally assumed in medieval\nEuropean theory (with a few interesting variations), makes both the\n2:3:4 and its &quot;conversity&quot; of 3:4:6 pure.\n\nIn neo-medieval music, however, the fifths are often tuned somewhat\nwider than pure, and the fourths somewhat narrower, with about 2 cents\nof tempering standard.\n\nIt should be noted that in the 18th-19th century styles discussed by\nJon Szanto, a complete 2:3:4 or 3:4:6 trine of medieval or\nneo-medieval styles would be considered some kind of incomplete\nsonority, for example a portion of a 4:5:6 triad. Similarly, in the\n21st-century decatonic harmony of Paul Erlich based on a complete\n4:5:6:7 tetrad, the complete 4:5:6 triad of 18th-century music would\nbe considered an incomplete portion of a tetrad.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@value.net\n\n\n\n"

Although some in both groups want me to send\nto only ONE group, I have yet to figure out why.  I\nhave gotten answers from both groups.  The DELETE button\nis on my computer and gets used on messages that do not\nspeak to me.  But some insist on emailing me off-list\nand asking me to cease.  OK: I get the message.\n\nTo ALL: if my sig file is clicked, it can be seen that\nI was a professor of world literature classics over three\ndecades, among other unrelated odd jobs, including\nbeing a motion picture projectionist for 23 years, mostly\nsummers.  I have not been idle, as apparently have none\nof you.  I am also an author, and am working on another\nbook, ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  It might be also\nsubtitled Music of the Spheres.  I am not sure yet.  Time\nwill tell.    \n\nTwo decades ago, I published\na couple science papers on the broad topics: MUSIC OF THE SPHERES,\nBODE&#39;S LAW EXPLAINED,\nON THE SPECIAL THEORY OF ORDER [in contradistiction to Einstein&#39;s\n&quot;relativity theory&quot;: I consider his theory a statistical theory\nwithin the larger GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  I do not wish to go\ninto details, on these music theory lists, which may surprise and\nalso please some.]  A few members and I have an off-list correspondence.\nI hope to have my papers online for those so interested, as someone\nwho you all know has them now.  I believe the content will interest\nmusicologists with theoretic minds. \n\nAfter my initial papers two decades ago, Guy Murchie called me, and\nasked to write a paper about me for The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.  As a\nprerequisite, he invited me to his house in New Hampshire to conduct\na symposium on the subject.  To my surprise, when I got there, there\nwere two dozen mathematicians, scientists, mostly astrophysicists,\nphysicists, and musicologists.  Murchie was a Harvardian, which was\nright down the road in Boston.  I was stunned to lecture to those pure\nscience minds, as I was a THEORIST, but it went well, and the rest\nis history.  At this point: I am working on a last paper entitled\nON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  That is the reason for my questions\nto trained musicologists.  I apologize to those who found me a distraction,\nor boring, or whatever.  Unbeknownst to all, a few have emailed me off-list,\nand some have become communicators and others wished to take me to task.\nIt makes sense to me that members should answer questions if they wish,\nrather than lecture members and create ad hominems which only tend to\nshut down communication.  \n\nI wish to thank Pauline, Joe S and Joe M.  I am not disappearing,\nbut I am to become a lurker.  I have NOT gotten ALL my answers from you all,\nbut you all have been for the most part kind and gracious, and I thank\nyou.  To those who were annoyed, so be it.  I did not mean to be that,\nfiguring musicologists were interested in music theory.  I guess I was\nwrong.  If I was not, those who care need to speak up.  Otherwise, I will\nlurk.   \n\nAs said above: I KNEW Guy Murchie, have devoured his book\nMUSIC OF THE SPHERES.  Please understand, I have a vast library, and\nhave read many many many many many many many books on the subjects I\nam putting forth.  If you wonder why 7 manys, you might enjoy\nHemingway&#39;s HILLS LIKE WHITE ELEPHANTS  \n\nI know Pythagoras, et al., as anyone\nwho has read my papers will know.   I have read more books than\nI care to delineate.  \n\nAs I stated in my papers\nALL sciences are based on MATHEMATICS.  Anyone who does not\nagree with me on that is in DISAGREEMENT with me.  So be it.\nAs I said in my BODE&#39;S LAW EXPLAINED paper, and what impressed\nMurchie was just THAT.  I argued that MATH is the basis of\nMUSIC OF THE SPHERES.  It take PHYSICS to EXPLAIN the relationships\nof the ENTITIES observed by their mathematical trails, regardless\nof the DISCIPLINE.  I believe the (a) MATH and (b) PHYSICS relationship\nas I stated in this paragraph, implicitly.\n\nBecause you all have ADVANCED TUNING and TUNING-MATH beyond that\nof Murchie and others of two decades ago, things have changed.\nI had hoped that some of you could assist me.  In fact, I did\nopen up a few discussions which Pauline and others added to re:\nOrgans.  But it was a MEMBER who asked me NOT to take my thoughts\noff list.\n\nNow, I am NOT so sure.  No, I do not have all my answers, and will\nlurk and at some point ask a question, down the road, and answer those\nwho query me about my ideas re: Music of the Spheres. \n\nIt is the minds of musicologists which can assist the topic.  Do not\nforget that Pythagoras, et al., developed these theses millenniums ago,\nand it can take another couple millenniums to resolve the questions.\nFor those NOT interest in the subject, I apologize for bring it up.\n\nIn conclusion: if someone KNOWS of a message board which WELCOMES a\ndiscussion of MUSIC OF THE SPHERES and the MATH and PHYSICS thereof,\nlet me know.  I will take my question THERE.\n  \nThanks in advance. \n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

But I think those interested in tuning have the cart before the horse \n(music rack before the music) when they use math to create an arbitarary just \nscale, then write music to fit it. My approach as a trained musician \n(organist, composer, arranger, transcriber) was to take music that had \nalready been composed for tempered scales and determine what theoretical just \nscale would permit one to accurately play such music. And new music as well.\n\nAnd I found the answer--a scale based on the harmonic-partials spectrum \nrather than arbitararily chosen just intervals. As the notes in a chord need \nto be in agreement with their counterparts in the harmonic spectrum. Just as \norgan mutation stops with fractional footages need to be tuned to jsut \nintonation. And thus why ET isn&#39;t the best tuning for organs. The result was \nthe 0 #/b 19-limit (in C) Phillips Just Scale I posted here.\n\nOnce the best theoretical just scale was determined, it had to be made \npractical. As it has more notes per octave in the wrong places than a \npractical keyboard will permit. A practical keyboard simply cannot have a # \nand b at the same digital location. As one interval will be smaller in reach \nthan normaal, and the other larger. Such not only creates awkwardness, but \nprohibits the player from playing without looking at the keys. As any \nproffessional musican is supposed to be able to do. Such digitals were never \npopular when used on organs historically.\n\nA proper scale and keyboard can&#39;t be just for experimenters. They needs to be \nuseful to trained musicians willing to use them.\n\nThe solution was to slightly temper (- 2 cents) the just 5th in the scale to \nthe ET 5th. This caused the 7Eb and D# to virtually merge in pitch, and the \n7Ab and G# likewise. Tempering the just major 3rds 1-2 cents merged them \ncompletely. But then, since the harmonic minor 7ths are also used as D# and \nG# they had to be raised or lowered 1 cent to make a perfect match. The \nresult was the 0 #/b 19-limit (in C) Phillips Just-Temperament Scale I posted \nhere. (The 19th limit is Eb--298 cents 19/16. While C doesn&#39;t use it in its \nchromatic scale, it does use flatted chords occasionally.)\n\nA practical just-temperament keyboard has to have split digitals for \nrarely-used notes. But they must be in the same general location for a given \ndiatonic key signature as the regular digitals. Thus, since C uses no #s nor \nbs, all the split digitals for that key are white ones. Septimal c and \ntertian e, using the same scale and tuning, do use bs and #s, but the regular \nblack keys are used for them with my tuning and keyboard layout. The same \nbasic principles apply to all other key signatures commonly used.\n\nSincerely,\nPauline W.

But I think those interested in tuning have the cart before the horse (music rack\n&gt; before the\n&gt; music) when they use math to create an arbitarary just scale, then write music to fit\n&gt; it. My\n&gt; approach as a trained musician (organist, composer, arranger, transcriber) was to take\n&gt; music that\n&gt; had already been composed for tempered scales and determine what theoretical just scale\n&gt; would\n&gt; permit one to accurately play such music.

I agree with you, and with your statement here;\nall I MEANT by that was: All sciences are BASED on mathematics.  That means, that one\nmust\nUSE the system of basic MATH somewhere, somplace, in the manipulation of the science\ndiscipline the scientist is working in: in other words, I see musicologists as\nscientists,\nand they USE MATH at times to EXPLAIN things.  The danger has been that in the attempt\nto understand THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES concept, astronomers who rule the roost in thAT\ndiscipline have violated basic MATH principles when they measure the solar-planetary\nsystem.  As I wrote in BODE&#39;S LAW EXPLAINED, they use the a.u., the measure between\nSun-Earth distance as the ruler of the system, and I say that is WRONG, that the\nmeasuring stick should be the Sun-Mercury distance, then all the MEAN data numbers become\na &quot;natural series of numbers&quot; as expressed by Margo, below, about MUSIC and I have\napplied the same logic to the SPHERES.

Schulter&quot; &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; \nDate:  Sun Oct 20, 2002  2:12 am\nSubject:  Re: [tuning math] Re: everyone concerned\n\n\nHello, there, everyone, and how one analyzes 3:4:6 depends a great\ndeal upon what period or style of Western European or other theory one\nis focusing on.\n\nTo me, 3:4:6 is a variation on the more conclusive 2:3:4, with the\nlatter arrangement (outer 2:4 octave, 2:3 fifth below, 3:4 fourth\nabove) as a complete stable sonority in 13th-14th century music of\nWestern Europe.\n\nAs one theorist around 1300 explains, in 2:3:4 the intervals follow a\n&quot;natural series&quot; of numbers 2-3-4, with the 2:3 fifth &quot;preceding&quot; the\nmore complex 3:4 fourth.\n\nInterestingly, this passage was written about three centuries before\nthe discovery of the harmonic series, or of the way a vibrating string\nin effect subdivides itself to produce partials such as the 2:1 octave\nand 3:1 twelfth (fifth plus octave).\n\nIn the era around 1300, a theorist named Johannes de Grocheio\ndescribes a complete 2:3:4 sonority as manifesting _trina harmoniae\nperfectio_, the &quot;threefold perfection of harmony,&quot; since it includes\nall three simple stable consonances: the 2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth, and\n4:3 fourth.\n\nThis phrase leads to the modern English term &quot;trine&quot; for a complete\n2:3:4 sonority; in Gothic and neo-medieval styles, it defines the\nstandard of full stable harmony, and the ideal resolution for unstable\nsonorities.\n\nTheorists around 1300 also note that 2:3:4 is smoother than 3:4:6,\nwith the 3:4 fourth below the 4:6 or 2:3 fourth. Either is regarded by\nJacobus of Liege (c. 1325) as perfectly concordant, but with the first\nform generally preferable.\n\nThis preference, however, may vary: around 1030, Guido d&#39;Arezzo in his\n_Micrologus_ prefers the 3:4 fourth to the 2:3 fifth as a basic\ninterval, and advocates the placement of the fourth below the fifth in\na technique of three-voice singing which involves a series of 3:4:6\nsonorities.\n\nIf we want a name for the 3:4:6 reflecting later stylistic trends\naround the 13th century, we could call it a &quot;converse trine,&quot; since\nthe intervals are said to be arranged &quot;conversely&quot; (_e converso_) from\nthe more conclusive 2:3:4 sonority with the fifth below the fourth.\n\nA standard Gothic Pythagorean tuning, generally assumed in medieval\nEuropean theory (with a few interesting variations), makes both the\n2:3:4 and its &quot;conversity&quot; of 3:4:6 pure.\n\nIn neo-medieval music, however, the fifths are often tuned somewhat\nwider than pure, and the fourths somewhat narrower, with about 2 cents\nof tempering standard.\n\nIt should be noted that in the 18th-19th century styles discussed by\nJon Szanto, a complete 2:3:4 or 3:4:6 trine of medieval or\nneo-medieval styles would be considered some kind of incomplete\nsonority, for example a portion of a 4:5:6 triad. Similarly, in the\n21st-century decatonic harmony of Paul Erlich based on a complete\n4:5:6:7 tetrad, the complete 4:5:6 triad of 18th-century music would\nbe considered an incomplete portion of a tetrad.\n\nMost appreciatively,\n\nMargo Schulter\nmschulter@v...\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nMargo: your message was on tuning but SEEMS in response to tuning-math: but I am glad\nit is on tuning.  Margo, I have always seen what you express above as basic to MATH\nand I guess it speaks directly to musicologists:  your wrote, \n&quot;To me, 3:4:6 is a variation on the more conclusive 2:3:4, with the\nlatter arrangement (outer 2:4 octave, 2:3 fifth below, 3:4 fourth\nabove) as a complete stable sonority in 13th-14th century music of\nWestern Europe.&quot;\n\nIn my quest to understand MUSIC OF THE SPHERES, I observed the MEAN data of the orbitals\nof the planets from the center out toward the perimeter as, Sun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2,\nEarth 3, Mars 4, Ceres 8^*, Jupiter 15, Saturn 30, Uranus 60, Neptune 90, and Pluto at\n120, or in reverse, from out toward the center, Pluto 4/4, Neptune 3/4, Uranus 1/2,\nSaturn 1/4, Jupiter 1/8, Ceres 1/15, Mars 1/30, earth 1/40, Venus 1/60, Mercury 1/120,\nand Sun at 0.  It seems to me that your basic statement about Western music describes the\nsolar-planetary system MEAN oribital data quite well: &quot;As one theorist around 1300\nexplains, in 2:3:4 the intervals follow a &quot;natural series&quot; of numbers 2-3-4, with the 2:3\nfifth &quot;preceding&quot; the more complex 3:4 fourth.&quot;\n \n^* I explained in my papers, that the solar-planetary system is REAL, and not an\narbitrary structure such as DIFFERENT music systems, and therefore the Ceres orbital\nat 8 and the next at 15-16^* are points of discussion.  In attempts to EXPLAIN something\nobserved in MATH the observers has to seek the IDEAL just as Margo, I think, is pointing\nout in her fuller statement.\n \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n \nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

Do you differentiate between a tuning, a &#39;chord&#39; (multiple pitches sounding simultaneously), and a &#39;music&#39;. I ask this in seriousness, for this reason: while I can understand that planets may have relationships between their distances or their orbits, and I could see this translating into either a tuning or a chord (if even a slightly changing one), I have a hard time grasping how this is &#39;music&#39;.\n\nPlease bear in mind that it may be mostly a function of language (as in my post - \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39779\n\n- entitled Mr. Natural) being difficult when one&#39;s discussions enter &quot;multi-disciplinary&quot; mode! After all, isn&#39;t the term &quot;music of the spheres&quot; also appropriated by poets, playrights, and other artists?\n\nIf I have a better idea of how you view your data as &quot;music&quot;, it will help me (and others, I imagine) to guide you in your quest for new insights.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Do you differentiate between a tuning, a &#39;chord&#39; (multiple\npitches sounding simultaneously), and a &#39;music&#39;. I ask this in seriousness, for\nthis reason: while I can understand that planets may have relationships between\ntheir distances or their orbits, and I could see this translating into either a\ntuning or a chord (if even a slightly changing one), I have a hard time\ngrasping how this is &#39;music&#39;.\n\nPlease bear in mind that it may be mostly a function of language (as in my post\n- \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39779\n\n- entitled Mr. Natural) being difficult when one&#39;s discussions enter\n&quot;multi-disciplinary&quot; mode! After all, isn&#39;t the term &quot;music of the spheres&quot;\nalso appropriated by poets, playrights, and other artists?\n\nIf I have a better idea of how you view your data as &quot;music&quot;, it will help me\n(and others, I imagine) to guide you in your quest for new insights.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nWhy, Jon, thank you for caring to respond.\n\nYou know recently Margo and Joe Monzo posted about music theory 2:3:4 and Pythagoras,\nand therein lies my concern.  You know Guy Murchie wrote a book called MUSIC OF THE\nSPHERES.  And I am sure you know the CONTENT of that book, in which he showed\nrelationships, from his point of view, between the solar-planetary system and musical\nnumbers.  Now: I have stated, and will repeat: I have friends who are musicians,\nand will never understand music like you musicologists.  But, you can understand\nsomething I cannot, and both of us can arrive on the same &quot;common ground&quot; and\ncommunicate.  We cannot dispute that Pythagoras already knew that six-sided stones,\ngreen, were emeralds, and eight-sided stones, clear, were diamonds.  First the MATH,\nand then the PHYSICS, or shall we say, physical explanation, taking Aristotle&#39;s\ndefinition in mind, came after the MATH was percieved.\n\nJoe Monzo has a Pythagoras page.  Pythagoras, supposedly, created the Pythagorean\nTheory of the 2,3,5 triangle and all kinds of other theories about numbers.  Joe&#39;s\npage of Pythagoras speaks to you musicologists in ways it does not speak to me.\nIt is about musical strings that sing!  Can you relate to that?  Because that\nis HOW Pythagoras explained it, seeing the distances in a series of numbers,\nwhether planets or notes, they FELL at nautral numbers as Margo recently wrote.\nNow: I admit there are variant tunings, but we also know there ARE some tunings\nwhich are CLOSE to NAUTRAL WHOLE NUMBERS.  You all know this much better than I.\nBut Pythagoras supposedly SAW in the spacing of the planets, which I believe he\nsaw as &quot;octaval&quot; distances, remembering, only the visible planets were visible\nto him, the same spacing in certain scales in music called octaves.  Now, if you\nlook at the MEAN data of the planets, and pick their closest IDEAL oribtal &quot;natural&quot;\nnumbers, Sun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2, Earth 3, Mars 4, etc., well, lo! and behold!\nPythagoras APPEARS to be correct, and as Plato wrote, the REALITY does shadow\nthe IDEAL.  Now: it was Pythagoras who expressed it METAPHORICALLY as the planets\nsing [shall we say they were &quot;knotted&quot; like a quipu at certain junctures in a string?]!\nI say quipu advisedly.  A &quot;quipu&quot; is a knotted string which based on the arrangement\nof the knots, their distances from each other, etc., actually communicated a message.\nThus, a knotted string or a series of notes or a series of planets can be seen as\na message.  In other words, I agree with Pythagoras that a knotted string can sing!\nThink of it as DNA or RNA--or note that if I write: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, someone will say,\nhey, that is BLANK in numbering system BLANK, etc.  And if I write: 2:3:4, musicologist\nhave heart spasms, Margo thinking of the 1300s, and Joe Monzo thinking of Pythagoras,\nwhereas a couch potato might go, &quot;Huh?&quot;  The quipu sings to those who see the MATH!\n\nIf Pythagoras were here, I think he would say, knowing of the newly discovered planets,\nand projecting the IDEAL based on their MEANS, that to PLAY the CHORD one must hit\nall the O, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. notes, which I GUESSED were C notes and 2 Fs.  I still\ncannot get an answer or a better guess.  For all I know they may be natural F# and\nFb or Gb.  But then I do not know if they are natural anymore than I know that C is\na natural note.  But really, Jon, it is the MATH underlying this all that fascinates\nme.  And I guess, if it fascinates Margo, and Joe Monzo, then it ought to fascinate\nALL musicologists, particularly those who are TUNING and doing ADVANCED TUNING.\nNow, does that help?  I am trying as hard as I can to be clear and precise with\nwords I could not master in musicology with twenty more years studying, and I am\ntoo old to give it that time as the good Lord probably will not grand me that many.\nSo: can we get THERE [to an understanding] from HERE?\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

In gereral I feel \nthat I am &quot;finished&quot; with this topic. It was a few yeats ago that I wrote the paper, \nand I am much more interested in the music people (including myself) are writing, \nthan in what they are saying. But I do still believe what I wrote, and as long as \nanyone has reactions to what I wrote I am interested to discuss it, because maybe \nthey&#39;ll offer new insights, as a few Tuning List people have. And as I mentioned \nearlier, I&#39;ve had a nagging sense ever since this summer about your reactions \n(which seemed particularly intense, even personally offended), and those of some \nothers.\n\nOn the other hand you don&#39;t seem to feel so strongly about it anymore. Well \nanyway? toward &quot;wrapping it up&quot; I&#39;ll say a few more things:\n\n&gt; it is &quot;conflicting&quot; in the same sense that a single diatonic scale in \n&gt; ji or meantone is &quot;conflicting&quot;. \n\nThe same except that in this piece Johnston seems in his composing clearly to be \n*exploiting* the conflicts in the tuning to his musical ends rather than trying to \nresolve or get around them. That&#39;s what make this piece sound the way it does \n(&quot;microtonal,&quot; so to speak), and is why I included it in that part of my paper. This \nseemed to scandalize you in the summer, but perhaps it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. \n(By the way, Jon Szanto pointed out that I ought to put another reminder of which \nposts I am responding to, since it was so long ago. It was 38555 and 38622.)\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you say that the only intervals just intonation theory would \n&gt; consider \n&gt; &gt; &gt; truly consonant are 2:1, 3:2, 5:4, and maybe 7:4. but this \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even allow you to construct a consonant triad, since either a \n&gt; major \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or minor triad, while containing a 3:2 and a 5:4, must also \n&gt; contain a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6:5.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, yes. This would only support my point as far as beatlessness-\n&gt; as-criterion is \n&gt; &gt; concerned. \n&gt; \n&gt; how so?\n\nJust because my point was that if beating is problematic (beating frequently being \ncited as evidence of the flaws in 12-note ET), then it&#39;s hard to get away from \nbeating, no matter what you do. What you said there seemed to support that point.\n \n\n&gt; my point is that many even more consonant intervals, even major \n&gt; thirds in lower registers, can exhibit beating, and yet this rarely \n&gt; disturbs the &quot;just intonation theorist&quot; -- who instead tends to \n&gt; discover additional, *new* consonant intervals, as they tingle his or \n&gt; her palate in familiar yet unfamiliar ways.\n\n Is it possible that you, too, are misrepresenting &quot;the just intonation theorist,&quot; as if \nthere is one type? Granted, you know more of them than I do, but I certainly have \nheard beats disussed quite a bit as if they are evidence of a flawed interval, and \ngave you some examples in my last posts. \n\n\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, rather than me playing a guessing \n&gt; &gt; game, why don&#39;t you just tell me your explanation of the tension in \n&gt; that sort of \n&gt; &gt; augmented second, beyond the standard \n&gt; &gt; lowered-sixth-degree-and-raised-seventh-degree-needing-to-resolve \n&gt; type of \n&gt; &gt; explanation?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;guessing game&quot;? -- seems like we had a serious communication blip \n&gt; there. my apologies. anyway, it has to do with scalar gestalts and \n&gt; the like, \n\nI guess I&#39;ll have to guess what this means.\n\nthings that can coexist with &quot;just intonation theory&quot; (at \n&gt; least in my mind). so why do i have to go into this now? :) :) :) \n\nI guess it doesn&#39;t matter any more? \n\n\n&gt; the layers of subjectivity, of culture, that are buried in music of \n&gt; great worth, are immeasurable. i know of some staunch defenders \n&gt; of &quot;just intonation theory&quot; who hold to this most strongly, who feel \n&gt; it in their every musical bone. there is no contradition here.\n\nMaybe not in what your friends feel in their bones, just in what certain others run \naround proclaining. \n\n\n\n\n"

So I did.\n\nThere&#39;s more that you said, but you can go back and look yourself if you&#39;re \ninteested.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if taken to its extreme, this &quot;just intonation&quot; view would allow \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the very simplest and least ambiguous interval, the 1/1, to ever \n&gt; &gt; &gt; occur as a verticality in music (while of course saying nothing \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disallowing any conceivable melodic/horizontal intervals). and \n&gt; where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can one find examples of such an aesthetic? ironically enough, in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; second part of your paper!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re definitely going to need to explain that one. \n&gt; \n&gt; you have some single-voice pieces in the second part of your paper, \n&gt; don&#39;t you?\n\nAny solo piece is an example of a &quot;just intonation aesthetic&quot; which allows &quot;only the \n1/1 to ever occur as a verticality&quot;? That seems to be stretching it a bit, don&#39;t you \nthink? I don&#39;t think Joe Maneri would describe his &quot;aesthetic&quot; in that violin piece to \nyou in those terms. (Like saying a dinner of spaghetti with cheese represents a \nstyle of cuisine which disallows any use of tomato sauce, meat sauce, pesto. etc. Or \nsomething like that.)\n \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then why claim that some just intonation composers, any in fact \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; use &quot;interesting&quot; (for you) sonorities or intervals, are \n&gt; violating \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic premise of just intonation? without providing a single \n&gt; &gt; &gt; example of a composer who writes music consistent with the basic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; premise of just intonation as you see it? if you truly felt that \n&gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; none of your business, you wouldn&#39;t have made this claim. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re mixing up issues. I didn&#39;t claim in my paper that Sims, \n&gt; Stahnke, Johnston \n&gt; &gt; and Harrison don&#39;t *believe* in the basic premise of JI. I *did* \n&gt; claim that these \n&gt; &gt; four composers seem, in certain pieces, to be &quot;taking fundamental \n&gt; liberties with \n&gt; &gt; the just intonation model, admittedly or not,&quot; and that is a \n&gt; different thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;taking fundamental liberties with&quot; sure sounds like &quot;violating the \n&gt; basic premise of&quot;. so what&#39;s wrong with what i wrote above? what did \n&gt; i mix up?\n\nWhat they *believe* and what they *did*. If you really want to know, just go back \nto the original post and read it again. \n\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Notice, too, the difference between my &quot;taking liberties&quot; language \n&gt; and your \n&gt; &gt; &quot;violating&quot; memory of what I wrote. Taking liberties is what real \n&gt; artists often need \n&gt; &gt; to do, in my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; i guess i speak a different language then you. to me these terms mean \n&gt; pretty much the same thing. in your last sentence above, you&#39;ve spun \n&gt; them with a different connotation than the one i was originally \n&gt; thinking of, but that must reflect how my words sounded to you. \n\nYes, for me the difference is profound. &quot;Taking liberties&quot; reflects the point of view \nof the &quot;artist&quot; and his/her artistic needs, where as &quot;violating&quot; (a rule) reflects the \npoint of view only of the theory. (The way you used it, too, it seemed you thought I \nwas saying those composers were being naughty, unethical.)\n\nCheers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I happen to be a sucker for passion, and you seem passionately involved in your &#39;quest&#39;.\n\n&gt; You know Guy Murchie wrote a book called MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.\n\nFrom your posts, yes.\n\n&gt;  And I am sure you know the CONTENT of that book\n\nI absolutely *do not*. I have never read it nor know even the most gross detail about it&#39;s contents, save what references you have made in passing, which never seemed close enough to my knowledge base to get my hands around.\n\n&gt; Now: I have stated, and will repeat: I have friends who are \n&gt; musicians, and will never understand music like you musicologists.  \n\nWhoa. Stop right there.\n\nI am NOT a musicologist, and you must be quite careful to make assumptions like that on this list - it is a large and varied collection. I am a practicing, professional musician, and have been performing for over 30 years. My interest in tuning comes from a long associated with the composer Harry Partch and his works.\n\nI am NOT a musicologist.\n\n&gt; Joe&#39;s page of Pythagoras speaks to you musicologists in ways it \n&gt; does not speak to me.\n\nI very frequently find Joe&#39;s pages to be about as transparent as my shower doors, which (thankfully) spare the world from viewing me in the altogether.\n\n[snip long Pythagorian explanation...]\n\n&gt; Thus, a knotted string or a series of notes or a series of planets \n&gt; can be seen as a message.  In other words, I agree with Pythagoras\n&gt; that a knotted string can sing!\n\nFine. A static arrangement such as this is far from my view of music, unless I narrow down to what would actually be considered conceptual performance. If one wants to call this music, they may. I happen to still consider it relationships, or a tuning, or maybe a harmonization. And only if I were to feel poetic (with a license in my wallet) would I consider the orbits of the planets &#39;music&#39;.\n\nThe entire gang at celetial-tuning would probably disagree, apoplectically.\n\n&gt; But really, Jon, it is the MATH underlying this all that \n&gt; fascinates me.  And I guess, if it fascinates Margo, and Joe \n&gt; Monzo, then it ought to fascinate ALL musicologists, particularly \n&gt; those who are TUNING and doing ADVANCED TUNING.\n\nWrong. Not all tuning people are mathematicians, not all musicological tuning people are mathematicians, etc. I happen to be severely stunted in that area, but I thank good people on the list like Paul and Gene and Dave K. for giving me a greater understanding of how one can feel *exactly* as you do.\n\n&gt; Now, does that help?  I am trying as hard as I can to be clear and \n&gt; precise with words I could not master in musicology with twenty \n&gt; more years studying\n\nYes, you are doing fine. I have a better understanding of your position, and also it makes clear that I may not have much more in the way of helping you. But stick with the list, focus your questions (probably one or two per message would yield greater reponses), and just don&#39;t get discouraged if everyone doesn&#39;t see it the same way. The biggest thing to remember: there are many interests on this list - math, musicians, tuning fans, world musics, etc.\n\n&gt; So: can we get THERE [to an understanding] from HERE?\n\nProbably, so long as you accept the possibility that there isn&#39;t too much more to it!\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

The classical and medieval art of &quot;music&quot; (in the \nquadrivium with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy) was essentially \nthe theoretical study of proportions, with the acoustic realisation \nof those proportions (on the monochord or canon) a secondary or even \nincidental aspect. The proportions could be expressed as well in \narchitectural forms or in apparent distances between heavenly bodies. \nFrom these origins, the west has had a long tradition of talking \nabout architecture or celestial mechanics in terms of &quot;harmony&quot;.  The \nactual practice of music was never a central subject of this \ndiscipline, although there were isolated attempts to identify \nparticular configurations with real scales. (A beautiful example of \nthe use of classical _geometry_, on the other hand, to describe a \nmusical performance is to be found in Jon Barlow&#39;s _Xemharmonikon_ \narticle on Euclid&#39;s proofs as monochord examples). \n\nI think that &quot;music&quot;, in this quadrivial sense, remains useful for \ntalking about the basic _local_ pitch structures in music, both \nmelodic and harmonic, and is often delightfully useful in discussing \narchitectural forms or forms found in visual arts.  The application \nof whole number of proportions to natural systems, however, is more \nproblematic. The arrangement of planets around a sun at any given \npoint in time, for example, is the result of the historical \ninteraction of masses, distances, gravitation and probably a lot of \naccidents along the way.  Classical theorists knew precious little \nabout this, with their earth-centered and circular models, and we \nstill don&#39;t know enough.  This is notoriously complex (tried solving \nthe three-body problem lately?) and all the interest really lies - \nfor met, at least - in the details. A &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; model, \nbased upon static, whole number proportions is going to be a gross \nsimplification of a single moment in a dynamic system -- but how do \nyou choose the moment?  Pluto&#39;s not always the furthest out.  How do \nyou express the masses musically?  The masses are as essential as the \ndistances, aren&#39;t they?&quot;  \n\n&quot;That said, there have been interesting attempts to turn &quot;harmony of \nthe spheres&quot; models into real music. Laurie Spiegel did a dynamic \nversion of Kepler, with continuously sliding tones. Another \nintersting piece is Charles Dodge&#39;s _Earth&#39;s Magnetic Field_, \ndirecting translating one index of the effect of solar radiation on \nthe earth&#39;s magnetic field into audible sounds.  In both of these \ncases, however, we are not dealing with a actual, sounding, harmony \nmade by a natural phenomenon but rather with a mapping into a \nparallel experience that retains some proportional relationships. I \nthink that distinction is a subtle one and may often be lost.&quot;\n\n        \n\n\n"

My scale will play virtually\n&gt; any Western World music.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pauline\n\nDear Pauline\n\nI don&#39;t know which just tunings you&#39;ve read about but here are a few\nreflections to comment on your statement above.\n\nI&#39;ve just finished nine intensive 9 - 12 hour days as Musical Director\nof a theatre group. All the music was in Just Intonation. I used a\nslendro and two pelogs throughout. See http://www.unsork.info/tuning\n\nI was playing constantly throughout the nine days and the other\nmusicians, cast members, were in contact with the instruments and hence\nthe tunings, for hours each day. I would reckon that I can now speak\nwith some authority on just scale usage.\n\nOne of my objectives was to produce a soundscape that couldn&#39;t be pinned\ndown in time or geographical location, ie, non-Western, non-Eastern, and\naccording to the audience in a question and answer session after the\nfirst show, I met with some measure of success. The suspension of\ndisbelief was matched by a musical suspension of spatial and temporal\nreference.\n\nHaving said that some audience members heard strands of plainchant,\nothers hints of raga, hardly &quot;modern&quot; musics.\n\nAnother thing is that I, or rather my ears, never tired of making music\nwith the just scales. Every line and combination of motifs has a\nfreshness and the tiniest variation in accent or contour becomes\nimportant. This compares favourably with how I used to feel after a week\nof performing Bach or Villa-Lobos on the guitar in 12 tet. Even great\nmusic left me jaded.\n\nSo I would thoroughly recommend that you try out some of the tunings I\nuse because they now have some &quot;road muscle&quot; and I am delighted to say\nthat they have few if any limitations, unless, as I suspect, you are\nreferring to four part harmony of course. I would counter that the use\nof strings and of sustaining metallophones creates (IMHO) some of the\nmost compelling harmonies you will ever hear. In this case you learn to\ncreate the harmonic language over hours and days of trial and error\nrather than by  prior knowledge of the theoretical harmonic resources of\nthe scale, as in 12 tet.\n\nAnyway, given what I&#39;ve said, subjective though it may be, I can&#39;t think\nwhat else you might want from a scale, so I would have to disagree with\nyour statement.\n\nKind Regards\n\n\n"

Planets travel in elliptical orbits perturbed by each other\ngravitationally. So no nice circles with nice &#39;harmonic&#39; relationships.\n\nActually, &#39;harmonic&#39; ratios of orbital periods are I think unstable as they\nare &#39;resonant&#39;. So planets in this configuration probably won&#39;t remain that\nway for the long term.\n\n2. Most planets are oblate spheriods\n\n3. No solar system is stable, it is &#39;metastable&#39;.\n\nSo any &#39;music of the spheres&#39; would be a temporal sounding of planetary\nmotions over aeons of time.\n\nSo perhaps we should be talking about the &#39;quasi metastable orbital\nproportions of oblate spheriods&#39; - which probably isn&#39;t music.\n\nMark G\n\n\n\n"

The classical and medieval art of &quot;music&quot; (in the \nquadrivium with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy) was essentially \nthe theoretical study of proportions, \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExactly: Daniel Wolf, a member of these lists have my early papers of \ntwo decades ago with permission to put them online for scholarship\nand educational purposes, gratis, and if they are you will SEE my\nlong and involved discussion of PROPORTIONS: you are ABSOLUTELY right\non, in THIS PART of your statement.\n\nIn fact, Pythagoras, according to Guy Murchie, in MUSIC OF THE SPHERES,\ncirca 400 BC, wrote:\n\n&quot;There is geometry in the humming of the strings.\n There is music in the spacings of the spheres.&quot;\n\nDaniel, so far, we are on the same page! \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nDaniel writes:\nwith the acoustic realisation \nof those proportions (on the monochord or canon) a secondary or even \nincidental aspect. The proportions could be expressed as well in \narchitectural forms or in apparent distances between heavenly bodies.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nHere IS the ARCHITECTURE, as seen in the data:\n\nI, Bill Arnold would add, here, that in my paper published in Cycles Bulletin,\nVol. XXX, No. 4, 1979, I pointed out that any &quot;cycle&quot; is a IDEAL linear phenomenon\ncreated by a mathematician based upon a REAL observed phenomenon of an oscillating\nnature which inherently is &quot;circular,&quot; hence the mathematical expression thereof\ncontains the value of pi [3.14etc].  More anon.\n\nI published Arnold&#39;s Law in 1979, as follows:\nhowever, note I have added the Harmonic C Note [bodies] \n\nC Notes_____Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**\nOctaves            Or Perimeter\nOr Harmonics\n\n0***________Sun__________0___________0________0____________0\n1___________Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles\n2___________Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28\n?___________Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42\n4.09________Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56\n8.18________Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13\n16.4________Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12\n32.7________Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24\n65.4________Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49\n?___________Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74\n130.8_______Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99\n\n*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;\n\n**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet\n\n***the NO SOUND point, from which the C Scale originates in the 1 C Note,\nexpressed at a perimeter of pi [3.14] when it so oscillates and sounds,\naudibly to perception, however perceived: [to me, a scale is really a\nseries of concentric spheres of sound, with each higher note created\nby another sphere surrounding the inner spheres in the same way the\nMusic of the Spheres appears to us, visually and mathematically, with\nthe planetary orbitals as means of their distances, expressed as spheres.]\n\nSo, Daniel, what do you think about the IDEAL PROPORTIONS discovered in\nthe MUSIC OF THE SPHERES or spacings of the planets?\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \nDaniel writes:  The application \nof whole number of proportions to natural systems, however, is more \nproblematic. The arrangement of planets around a sun at any given \npoint in time, for example, is the result of the historical \ninteraction of masses, distances, gravitation and probably a lot of \naccidents along the way.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nNo doubt, Daniel, in the &quot;relativity&quot; of the system, individual orbitals\nthe way astronomers look at them are unique.  But I have postulated the\nSTATISTICAL MEAN or the AVERAGE distance DATA as relevant, over long\nperiods of time.  Mankind has viewed the planetary data for millennium\nand the planets are where predicted.  H.&#39;s Uncertainty Principle argues\nthat if a scientists seeks the particle, then wave data cannot be determined,\nand vice versa.  If the wave data is sought, the particle cannot be\ndetermined.  I covered this in my papers.    \n\nMusicologists KNOW that if only one bar of music is heard, one might not\nhear ALL notes.  But if lots and lots and LOTS of music is heard, one\nmight be able to ascertain ALL notes, yes, there will errant F# notes\nthat were meant to be F by the score sheet.  But, on average, over many\nnotes looked at, something could be said about the IDEAL MUSICAL TUNING\nof the particular system being analyzed.\n\nThink of it this way: suppose someone lives in the New York area, and over\na year uses a cell phone and is TRACKED by the police.  One day, or one\norbital will not NECESSARILY show where that person lives, resides, works.\nBut IF all calls are TRACKED for a year, then a SPHERE of data will show\nthe ORBITAL RANGE of positions of the CALLER.  \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nDaniel writes:\n  Classical theorists knew precious little \nabout this, with their earth-centered and circular models, and we \nstill don&#39;t know enough.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nNo, Daniel, I do not agree.  Two decades ago I published my BODE&#39;S LAW\nEXPLAINED and it proves that the solar-planetary system DATA over long\nperiods of time carves out CIRCULAR ORBITALS similar to DIFFRACTION PATTERNS\nOF ATOMS.  I made that point then, and reiterate it now.  Those PATTERNS\nof the ORBITALS have MEANS just as INTENDED F notes of an orchestra over\na long period of RECORDED time would show a MEAN OF F NOTES.  We all know\nwhat it means [pun intended :)] to SING off-pitch, and for some of us\nour ears hurt when notes are thrown too high and dropped too low.  But still,\nthe PURE IDEAL NOTE SCALE or the SCORE SHEET exists, and can be ascertained;\nin other words, the Bach piece EXISTS IDEALLY ON PAPER even though the \norchestra does not PLAY it PERFECTLY ON PITCH EACH AND EVERY TIME.\nThe SCORE SHEET is the IDEAL and I have given in Arnold&#39;s Law the IDEAL.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \nDaniel writes: \nThis is notoriously complex (tried solving \nthe three-body problem lately?) and all the interest really lies - \nfor met, at least - in the details. A &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; model, \nbased upon static, whole number proportions is going to be a gross \nsimplification of a single moment in a dynamic system -- but how do \nyou choose the moment?  Pluto&#39;s not always the furthest out.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBut Daniel, I THINK NOW you understand that Pluto has a MEAN which is,\nindeed, OUTSIDE the orbital of Neptune.  My paper covered all that.\nThere is, as you express above: A HARMONY OF THE SPHERES MODEL, and you\ncan SEE it in the DATA above.  It is AWESOMELY BEAUTIFUL like a crystal\nemerald with hexagonal six-sides or a diamond with pyramidal eight-sides.\nMusicologists can PROBABLY now RELATE to the NUMBERS??????????????? \n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

Planets travel in elliptical orbits perturbed by each other\ngravitationally. So no nice circles with nice &#39;harmonic&#39; relationships.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nHi, Mark Gould.  If you read my prior message to this list,\n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39825\n\n\n you will NOW\nUNDERSTAND that Plato spoke of the IDEAL and how REALITY shadows or mirrors\nthe IDEAL.  Musicologists KNOW that an IDEAL F note exists and try to play\nit, and like your referred to &quot;elliptical orbits&quot; do NOT always make it.\nBTW: members should know that astrophysics explains the individual\n&quot;ellipitcal orbits&quot; very nicely as a DANCE of the two centers of the Sun\nand the individual planet, and yes, there are other perturbations.  But\nas Pauline points out, the same thing happens in REALITY when she plays\nher organ and individual pipes INTERFER with each other, or the organist\nmis-hits a key, or the pedal was held too-o-o-o-o long, or whatever.  But\nthe IDEAL Bach piece on the SOCRE SHEET that Pauline looks at, is IDEAL.\n\nThus, Mark, there ARE NICE CIRCLES WITH NICE HARMONIC relationships on\npaper in the STATISTICAL DATA.  That is ALL Pythagoras or I have said.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nActually, &#39;harmonic&#39; ratios of orbital periods are I think unstable as they\nare &#39;resonant&#39;. So planets in this configuration probably won&#39;t remain that\nway for the long term.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAre you talking about entropy from an IDEAL state?  This is a LIST about TUNING,\nand WHO knows WHO keeps the solar-planetary system TUNED [pun intended :) ]  \nActually, Mark, PHYSICS explains ENTROPY as a decaying state over TIME from\nan IDEAL state which existed, at some prior point.\n\nBut, can YOU now SEE the IDEAL state in the IDEAL data?  This is NOT a\nPHYSICS list, so I will not go into the relationship of the IDEAL solar-planetary\nsystem to TIME, as that is a matter for another day and place.  But Pauline could\ntell you much about ENTROPY of pipes TUNED at a certain point in TIME and probably\npredict when CERTAIN pipes need to be TUNED anew.  I don&#39;t have a clue :)\n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

I replaced it with what appears to be the correct 14-\net\n&gt; version. As a bonus, I tried one of the scales I&#39;m currently \nplaying with,\n&gt; an 11-note MOS with generators of 318.4 cents and 1203.0 cents. \nNaturally,\n&gt; one note of the 12-et original had to be duplicated in order to map \nit to\n&gt; the 11-note scale, and there are many possible ways of mapping the \nnotes. I\n&gt; tried a couple different mappings, and surprisingly, one of them \ncame out\n&gt; reasonably well, considering that Ravel never intended this music \nto be\n&gt; heard with this kind of scale. It&#39;s quite dissonant in parts, but a \nfew of\n&gt; the chords are really nice, and the melody is at least recognizable.\n&gt; Somewhere along the line, it sounds like some of the notes turned \nout\n&gt; wrong, but that only adds to the weird quirkiness of this tuning. \nHere&#39;s\n&gt; the link:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/pavane-z11.mid\n\nin case anyone&#39;s interested in this scale a little more \ntheoretically, i believe that for all intents and purposes herman is \ntalking about this scale:\n\nhttp://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/ChainOfMinor3rds.htm\n\n\n"

It is as if someone took square sections of the piece and cut them out, pasting them on top of each other and destoying any of the material lining up. IIRC, the bottom info has been truncated as well. You can see numbers, lines, etc. but they are jumbled.\n\n&gt; i could try making another one off the .bmp or just sending you \n&gt; the .bmp itself, and we could go from there . . .\n\nYou do need to make another, or try to redo a .gif from the .bmp. I pointed George Secor to the following small and free bmp2gif tool:\n\nhttp://download.com.com/3000-2192-870646.html?tag=lst-4-24\n\n \n&gt; p.s. i thought yellow was a good color because i didn&#39;t want it \n&gt; to be obtrusive, but you can still read off the errors of the \n&gt; consonant intervals of any ET if you so desire . . . \n\nIt is *not* a good choice because of the amount of light coming out of both the white and yellow pixels. Many people (according to web [as well as computer/screen] usability studies) find this very hard on the eyes. Many other pastels would work, but it *does* need to stand out just a tad more.\n\n&gt; also, yes, this page might very well end up in a XH article, in \n&gt; which case printing to black and white would be a must . . .\n\nNot with a grant or independent funding! :) Well, if it was color printing then the yellow would work, otherwise you&#39;ll have to grey it or use some kind of dotted/dashed line.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

Well \n&gt; anyway? toward &quot;wrapping it up&quot; I&#39;ll say a few more things:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; it is &quot;conflicting&quot; in the same sense that a single diatonic \nscale in \n&gt; &gt; ji or meantone is &quot;conflicting&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; The same except that in this piece Johnston seems in his composing \nclearly to be \n&gt; *exploiting* the conflicts in the tuning to his musical ends rather \nthan trying to \n&gt; resolve or get around them.\n\nno problem there!\n\n&gt; That&#39;s what make this piece sound the way it does \n&gt; (&quot;microtonal,&quot; so to speak), and is why I included it in that part \nof my paper. This \n&gt; seemed to scandalize you in the summer, but perhaps it doesn&#39;t \nmatter anymore.\n\nwell, i think johnston believes in *more* of the tenets of the &quot;just \nintonation movement&quot; than i do, and i *still* don&#39;t feel he&#39;s taking \nany &quot;fundamental liberties&quot; with any of those tenets in this piece. \nok?\n \n&gt; (By the way, Jon Szanto pointed out that I ought to put another \nreminder of which \n&gt; posts I am responding to, since it was so long ago. It was 38555 \nand 38622.)\n\ngood to have them there for reference. i&#39;ll only go back if i feel a \n*need* to get caught up in this again. i hope, instead, to &quot;escape&quot; \nfrom this debate, as i feel it&#39;s up to the &quot;just intonation \nmovement&quot;, not me, to refute your claims.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say that the only intervals just intonation theory would \n&gt; &gt; consider \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truly consonant are 2:1, 3:2, 5:4, and maybe 7:4. but this \n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even allow you to construct a consonant triad, since either a \n&gt; &gt; major \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or minor triad, while containing a 3:2 and a 5:4, must also \n&gt; &gt; contain a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6:5.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes. This would only support my point as far as \nbeatlessness-\n&gt; &gt; as-criterion is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; how so?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just because my point was that if beating is problematic (beating \nfrequently being \n&gt; cited as evidence of the flaws in 12-note ET), then it&#39;s hard to \nget away from \n&gt; beating, no matter what you do. What you said there seemed to \nsupport that point.\n\nfirstly, i&#39;ll just note that the interval 7:6, which you seem to like \nin your paper, clearly falls into the category of intervals referred \nto above.\n\nnow, let me address this:\n\n&quot;beating frequently being cited as evidence of the flaws in 12-note \nET&quot;\n\nwell, i think it&#39;s more like this -- one of the most straightforward \n(and hence perhaps too-frequently cited) audible demonstrations of \nthe difference in sound between equal temperament and just intonation \nis to play some of these basic, ultra-consonant intervals and compare \nthem. i believe even isacoff does this on his webpage. you can \nimmediately hear (actually, i know some great musicians who can&#39;t) \nthat at least *some* of the beating present in the equal temperament \nchord disappears entirely in the just intonation version.\n\nnow, the thing is, *exactly* the same effect happens (but slightly \ndiminished in prominence) in the case of the minor sixth -- \nespecially the 8:5 minor sixth, but even, under ideal listening \nconditions, the 13:8 and 14:9 minor sixths. you&#39;ll hear that certain \nbeating overtones in the equal-tempered minor sixth simply cease to \nbeat in the just intonation version. the tuning is &quot;smoothed-out&quot; -- \nas far as reducing roughness is concerned, the 8:5 tuning is optimal \nwithin the range of &quot;minor sixths&quot;, within the range of intervals \nthat serve that &quot;particular musical function&quot;. sure, there may still \nbe other overtones that beat -- but this is a necessary, unavoidable \naspect of all intervals in this range.\n\ndoes that mean that all &quot;minor sixths&quot; are somewhat rough? my \nroommate in college, who was taking music courses but had no \nknowledge of acoustics, tuning, ratios, etc., played the piano and \nasked me this question. &quot;why is this interval [plays C-F#] just as \ndissonant as this interval [plays C-Ab]&quot;? he was really bugged by \nthis since he was being taught, in his music class, that these \nintervals fell into completely different categories: dissonant, and \nconsonant, respectively. well, we both know the answer, julia -- \n*context* makes the difference, and can have all kinds of influence \non the perceived tension or lack thereof of any element of a musical \ncomposition. in fact the very projection of the interval *as* a minor \nsixth (as an interval subtending six scale degrees in the operative \ndiatonic scale) is quite key to the &quot;consonant&quot; quality it acquires \nin Western music. note that &quot;augmented fifths&quot;, while the same size \nacoustically, sound like (and are considered) dissonances! of all our \nmodern consonances, the minor sixth was the *last* to be accepted \ninto the pantheon, as margo has documented.\n\ni don&#39;t think the &quot;just intonation movement&quot; denies this &quot;context-\nrelativity&quot; -- it&#39;s just that many of its advocates want to go back \nto the basic qualities of intervals and chords *themselves*, such as \nwhat my roommate was responding to, and work their way up to complete \nmusical pieces from there. it&#39;s a &quot;rebellious&quot; movement that &quot;cuts \nthe cord&quot; with Western musical culture, with which it is \ndisenchanted, and looks to the study of basic musical materials as a \nmeans toward erecting a new culture. perhaps, given as many centuries \nto develop as european music has had, it will produce works of great \npower and meaning that would impress even you. maybe it won&#39;t. \nanyway, the 8:5 in just intonation can certainly be projected as a \nconsonance by all sorts of &quot;contextual&quot; methods -- most \nstraightforwardly, by contrasting it with the *still rougher* \nintervals that surround it or that pepper the intervallic landscape \n(see helmholtz&#39;s chart again or any of the more modern variations), \nor by implying a complete triad through successive alternation with \nthe missing triad member, etc. . . . in other just intonation \ncontexts, say something &quot;gothic&quot;, the 8:5 might be used as a \n(somewhat smooth) version of a *dissonance* -- since in the context \nof gothic music, *all* minor sixths (let along augmented fifths) are \nprojected as dissonances.\n\nwhat is probably more important than beating, by the way, is that all \nthe *combinational tones* of the 8:5 minor sixth *line up*. while a \nminor sixth in equal temperament produces all sorts of combinational \ntones, including one or two still audible at low volumes, for example \nthe minor sixth a-f&#39; will produce, in the ear, an F (complete with \nits own series of harmonics) that is 67 cents sharp relative to the \nhigh F! for the just intonation a-f&#39;, this F is perfectly in tune \nwith the high F. someone who works with equal temperament all the \ntime learns to &quot;filter out&quot; these out-of-tune combinational tones, \nexcept in extreme examples like two flutes playing high and \nloud . . . but if you spend some time with the sounds of just \nintonation, these &quot;defects&quot; (from the just intonation movement&#39;s \npoint of view) of equal temperament will stick out like a sore thumb. \nhelmholtz does discuss combinational tones, so you should be able to \nlearn more about them even if you don&#39;t have anything more recent. in \nany case it should be clear that the idea of a &quot;just intonation minor \nsixth&quot; is by no means a contradiction in terms!\n\nthen there&#39;s the whole virtual pitch issue . . .\n\n&gt; &gt; my point is that many even more consonant intervals, even major \n&gt; &gt; thirds in lower registers, can exhibit beating, and yet this \nrarely \n&gt; &gt; disturbs the &quot;just intonation theorist&quot; -- who instead tends to \n&gt; &gt; discover additional, *new* consonant intervals, as they tingle \nhis or \n&gt; &gt; her palate in familiar yet unfamiliar ways.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Is it possible that you, too, are misrepresenting &quot;the just \nintonation theorist,&quot; as if \n&gt; there is one type? Granted, you know more of them than I do, but I \ncertainly have \n&gt; heard beats disussed quite a bit as if they are evidence of a \nflawed interval, and \n&gt; gave you some examples in my last posts. \n\nsee above.\n\nlook, not all just intonation theorists have all their theory correct \nand/or consistent. in fact, i&#39;m the bane of all of them on this \nlist :) but that&#39;s where i come in saying your response is &quot;shallow&quot;. \nthe fact is that any just intonationist, and plenty of musically \nuntrained experimental subjects, can hear the &quot;smoothness&quot; (defined \nby *relative* lack of beating, alignment of combinational tones, \netc.) of the 8:5 in contradistinction to the relative &quot;roughness&quot; of \nother minor sixths / augmented fifths. so when a minor sixth is \ncalled for, the &quot;just intonationist&quot; tends to shoot for the 8:5 \n(though the 13:8, 14:9, or even more complex intervals can often be \nmore desirable depending on context).\n\nmy gut reaction was that it was exceedingly pedantic, and almost \nwillfully distancing, to point out that the minor sixth has some \nbeating in it, and to present that if that were some kind of &quot;show-\nstopper&quot; for the rest of the just intonation programme. maybe some \nproponent of just intonation made a statement that wasn&#39;t 100% \naccurate in a scientific sense, but your attempt to make a serious \nissue out of this in your paper led me to feel that you really must \nhave delved only very &quot;shallowly&quot; into just intonation theory and \npractice. the argument reminded me, strangely enough, of some \nmedieval proofs of the existence of god, because it so simplistic, \nand yet is presented in such a way as to make any alternative seem \nutterly absurd. yet if you felt this argument really had any weight --\n that is, if it were capable of convincing even one just \nintonationist to &quot;switch sides&quot; -- then you really must feel that the \njust intonation movement is based on flimsy foundations indeed. and \nthat is why i felt insulted on its behalf.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, rather than me playing a guessing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; game, why don&#39;t you just tell me your explanation of the \ntension in \n&gt; &gt; that sort of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; augmented second, beyond the standard \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lowered-sixth-degree-and-raised-seventh-degree-needing-to-\nresolve \n&gt; &gt; type of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;guessing game&quot;? -- seems like we had a serious communication \nblip \n&gt; &gt; there. my apologies. anyway, it has to do with scalar gestalts \nand \n&gt; &gt; the like, \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I&#39;ll have to guess what this means.\n\nwell, for example the idea that the diatonic scale provides the \noverwhelming &quot;pitch gestalt&quot; for western tonal music, and . . . well \ni could go on but . . .\n\n&gt; things that can coexist with &quot;just intonation theory&quot; (at \n&gt; &gt; least in my mind). so why do i have to go into this now? :) :) :) \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess it doesn&#39;t matter any more? \n\ni&#39;ll leave it up to you whether we should continue on this . . . \n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the layers of subjectivity, of culture, that are buried in music \nof \n&gt; &gt; great worth, are immeasurable. i know of some staunch defenders \n&gt; &gt; of &quot;just intonation theory&quot; who hold to this most strongly, who \nfeel \n&gt; &gt; it in their every musical bone. there is no contradition here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe not in what your friends feel in their bones, just in what \ncertain others run \n&gt; around proclaining.\n\ni&#39;ll leave it to you to point out where you see this contradiction, \nand to those others to then respond -- perhaps my friend (in the \nsense above, and i hope in others) kraig grady would like to chime \nin, or jon szanto i think could especially have something to say \nsince he defended the &quot;just intonation movement&quot; against my attacks \nin the past . . . as for those who would like to build up a musical \nlanguage from scratch, &quot;immune&quot; from any cultural effects, devoid of \nany cultural &quot;baggage&quot;, i say good luck, i know that that is not how \ni can listen to or create music most of the time, but that doesn&#39;t \nmean your programme is worthless or doomed to failure . . . i find \nthat such experiments can certainly be a fruitful source of \ninspiration, if nothing else.\n\np.s. do you get now what i was saying about how many of the examples \nin the second part of your paper would represent the &quot;paragon of \nconsonance&quot; according to your own depiction of what is fundamental to \njust intonation?\n\n\n"

So I did.\n\nthere seems to me to be an important difference between \nmere &quot;maximazation of the simplest ratios in music&quot; (as an \noverarching musical directive) and attempting to give a flavor of \nwhat &quot;just intonation&quot; means by stating that its use is characterized \nby &quot;a strongly-implied preference for the smallest numbers compatible \nwith a given musical purpose.&quot; a *given* musical purpose, which could \neasily entail all kinds of *dissonance* (by various definitions), or \nmore to the point, *new intervals* occuring in every nook and cranny \nof the intervallic continuum. just a fair reading of doty&#39;s sole post \nhere in reply to you, or looking deeper into his primer, should show \nthat he is not after a mere &quot;maximazation of the simplest ratios in \nmusic&quot; as a compositional aesthetic. maybe relative to 20th century \nclassical music, he is, but even so, there would be lots of *new \nintervals* introduced, harmonically let alone melodically.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if taken to its extreme, this &quot;just intonation&quot; view would \nallow \n&gt; &gt; only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the very simplest and least ambiguous interval, the 1/1, to \never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occur as a verticality in music (while of course saying \nnothing \n&gt; &gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disallowing any conceivable melodic/horizontal intervals). \nand \n&gt; &gt; where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can one find examples of such an aesthetic? ironically \nenough, in \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second part of your paper!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re definitely going to need to explain that one. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you have some single-voice pieces in the second part of your \npaper, \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any solo piece is an example of a &quot;just intonation aesthetic&quot; which \nallows &quot;only the \n&gt; 1/1 to ever occur as a verticality&quot;? That seems to be stretching it \na bit, don&#39;t you \n&gt; think? I don&#39;t think Joe Maneri would describe his &quot;aesthetic&quot; in \nthat violin piece to \n&gt; you in those terms.\n\nexactly! but the very terms *you* use to paint the &quot;just intonation \naesthetic&quot;, when you focus on beating and the like, taken to their \nlogical extreme, would indeed permit such a description. i feel this \nis an essential point.\n\n&gt;(Like saying a dinner of spaghetti with cheese represents a \n&gt; style of cuisine which disallows any use of tomato sauce, meat \nsauce, pesto. etc. Or \n&gt; something like that.)\n\nok, maybe it was a bit pedantic, but it was intended to show that \nthere is absolutely no restriction on allowed melodic intervals, even \nwhen this &quot;just intonation&quot; view is taken to its extreme.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then why claim that some just intonation composers, any in \nfact \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use &quot;interesting&quot; (for you) sonorities or intervals, are \n&gt; &gt; violating \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the basic premise of just intonation? without providing a \nsingle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example of a composer who writes music consistent with the \nbasic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; premise of just intonation as you see it? if you truly felt \nthat \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; none of your business, you wouldn&#39;t have made this claim. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re mixing up issues. I didn&#39;t claim in my paper that Sims, \n&gt; &gt; Stahnke, Johnston \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Harrison don&#39;t *believe* in the basic premise of JI. I \n*did* \n&gt; &gt; claim that these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; four composers seem, in certain pieces, to be &quot;taking \nfundamental \n&gt; &gt; liberties with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the just intonation model, admittedly or not,&quot; and that is a \n&gt; &gt; different thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;taking fundamental liberties with&quot; sure sounds like &quot;violating \nthe \n&gt; &gt; basic premise of&quot;. so what&#39;s wrong with what i wrote above? what \ndid \n&gt; &gt; i mix up?\n&gt; \n&gt; What they *believe* and what they *did*. If you really want to \nknow, just go back \n&gt; to the original post and read it again. \n\ni don&#39;t think i mixed up what they *believe* and what they *did*. not \nin the original post or more recently. you&#39;re claiming that the two \ncontradict one another, while i&#39;m claiming that they don&#39;t. you \nsay &quot;admittedly or not&quot;. if &quot;not&quot;, then this implies that whay they \n*did* contradicts what they *believe*, right? my response is that i \ndon&#39;t think you have necessarily looked deeply enough into what it is \nthat they do *believe*, and that therefore you may have, in many \ncases, seen a contradiction where none, in fact, exists.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Notice, too, the difference between my &quot;taking liberties&quot; \nlanguage \n&gt; &gt; and your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;violating&quot; memory of what I wrote. Taking liberties is what \nreal \n&gt; &gt; artists often need \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do, in my opinion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i guess i speak a different language then you. to me these terms \nmean \n&gt; &gt; pretty much the same thing. in your last sentence above, you&#39;ve \nspun \n&gt; &gt; them with a different connotation than the one i was originally \n&gt; &gt; thinking of, but that must reflect how my words sounded to you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, for me the difference is profound. &quot;Taking liberties&quot; reflects \nthe point of view \n&gt; of the &quot;artist&quot; and his/her artistic needs, where as &quot;violating&quot; (a \nrule) reflects the \n&gt; point of view only of the theory. (The way you used it, too, it \nseemed you thought I \n&gt; was saying those composers were being naughty, unethical.)\n\nno, not that -- what i think you&#39;re saying is that these composers \nare _deceived_ in certain respects, if they believe their own works \nflow from or conform to the tenets of just intonation theory that \nthey hold as true.\n\nthat struck me as potentially a bit insulting as well, because it \nimplies that you know *more* about both what they believe, and what \nthey did, than they do . . . and thus you&#39;re able to &quot;uncover&quot; the \ndecpetion . . . and at least on the former (believing) point, my \ninitial, gut reaction was that your paper demonstrated that you \nprobably knew *less*, not *more*. forgive me for being so blunt. at \nthis point, assuming that you&#39;ve finally understood my point, i&#39;d \nlike to *withdraw* myself from it, since i feel any of these \ncomposers would, given enough time and face-to-face interaction with \nmusical instruments and the like, be able to give a better defense of \nthe consistency between what they *believe* and what they *did* than \ni ever could, or would want to . . .\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers.\n\nsame to you and yours!\n\n\n"

Many people (according to web &gt;\n[as well as computer/screen] usability studies) find this very hard \n&gt;on the eyes.\n\nthe number of yellow pixels is less than 1% of the number of white \npixels. so i doubt that changing from yellow to some other color \nwould significantly change the amount of light coming out.\n\n&gt;Many other pastels would work, but it *does* need to stand out just \n&gt;a tad more.\n\nwait until you view the non-munged version, and then tell me the \nyellow lines, though subtle, don&#39;t convey the necessary information.\n\n&gt; &gt; also, yes, this page might very well end up in a XH article, in \n&gt; &gt; which case printing to black and white would be a must . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; Not with a grant or independent funding! :) Well, if it was color \n&gt;printing then the yellow would work, otherwise you&#39;ll have to grey \n&gt;it or use some kind of dotted/dashed line.\n\nalready dotted/dashed except for the 0-cent-deviation-from-just-\nconsonance lines.\n\n\n"

In C thats C, D, E, G , A \nand B. F \n&gt; has its own scale, as there&#39;s no low-order harmonic-partial ratio \nfor it in \n&gt; C.. Thus more than one scale and keyboard has to be used at a time \nto play \n&gt; most compositions.\n\nsounds complex. but it certainly seems your statement about your \nsystem being the *only* such-and-such was not correct.\n\n&gt; &gt; also, i find the comma shifts in your system, as well as those in \n&gt; &gt; above systems, problematic for both the performer and for the \n&gt; &gt; listener. from the latter point of view, for Western music before \n&gt; &gt; beethoven, i far prefer vicentino&#39;s second tuning of 1555, in \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; the triads are perfectly just.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; I made no comma shifts as such.\n\nin the last example you provided, wasn&#39;t the note e moving up by a \ncomma from the c-major chord to the a-minor chord?\n\n&gt; I simply deutune very slightly the just \n&gt; intervals. There&#39;s no problem in playing. I&#39;ve played hundreds of \nshort \n&gt; pieces to test it. The reason many have problems with scales is \nthey try to \n&gt; use too few notes per oectave,\n\ncan you give some examples of who &quot;they&quot; are?\n\n&gt; or cram too many in a keyboard. \n&gt; \n&gt; The solution is to use more than one keyboard, each tuned to a \ndifferent \n&gt; scale. Three are needed. One for the tonic, another for the \nsubdominant, And \n&gt; the third for the dominant, or a flatted-chord scale. For example, \none short \n&gt; piece in C I play uses the IV scale, I scale, and IIb scale to \nprovide a VIb \n&gt; phrase.\n\nhow many pitches in all three keyboards put together?\n\n\n"

(offlist)\n\nLooks like Yahoo was originally mucking up the download (not unknown). I re-downloaded and it is OK.\n \n&gt; the number of yellow pixels is less than 1% of the number of white \n&gt; pixels. so i doubt that changing from yellow to some other color \n&gt; would significantly change the amount of light coming out.\n\nThe point is not how many are yellow, it&#39;s that the ones that are are so close in the light spectrum to the white. It is tiring on the eyes and more difficult to see than a slightly darker hue. I couldn&#39;t even see that they were dotted/dashed til I zoomed in quite a bit.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: while the light in a room may vary, a printed page will look (essentially) identical when distributed to many people, but the many variations on how a person will have set the controls on their monitor (brightness, contrast, and especially the gamma correction) makes color decisions for these images difficult. It could be that your monitor is set darker than most.\n\nAnyhow, it is up to you; I could certainly make samples with other colors, as it is easy to alter the .gif palettes and resave. But if you ignore the studies of people who study people looking at monitors, you run the risk of having less impressive results than you seek.\n\nCheers,\nJon \n\n\n"

No?\n\n&gt; and anyway, my objection (not long ago) was mainly intended to\n&gt; point out that beating is a function of our limited hearing\n&gt; resolution -- two notes 1 Hz apart might be resolved as separate\n&gt; pitches, without any perception of beating, by an organism from\n&gt; another planet (probably a large, slow-moving being).\n\nHuh.\n\n-Carl\n\n\n"

Just harder than sending a color image and expecting it to automatically come out fine when reduced to black and white.\n\n&gt; Tho IMO b&w would look best on XH.\n\nJust out of curiousity, why? I was being cute when I talked about funding for the color graphics, but in what situation would this much information, especially where the eye needs to track things, be better in b/w than color?\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

We \nall know\n&gt; what it means [pun intended :)] to SING off-pitch, and for some of \nus\n&gt; our ears hurt when notes are thrown too high and dropped too low.  \nBut still,\n&gt; the PURE IDEAL NOTE SCALE or the SCORE SHEET exists, and can be \nascertained;\n&gt; in other words, the Bach piece EXISTS IDEALLY ON PAPER even though \nthe \n&gt; orchestra does not PLAY it PERFECTLY ON PITCH EACH AND EVERY TIME.\n&gt; The SCORE SHEET is the IDEAL and I have given in Arnold&#39;s Law the \nIDEAL.\n\nfirst of all, the musical pitch standard has risen dramatically over \ntime and varied from location to location. it&#39;s completely arbitrary \nwhat letter name is assigned to what frequency, but it helps to have \na standard, and today in the united states it&#39;s C-264, A-440, etc., \nbut this could change again in the future, and i believe it&#39;s higher \nin europe. secondly, bach&#39;s ideal tuning was almost certainly \nsomething resembing Werckmeister III or Kellner&#39;s Bach tuning -- but \nthis is only defined up to the *relative* proportions of the notes, \nnot their absolute frequencies. hope this helps.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nI thank you kindly for the response.  It would help me more if you\nwould give me the NAME of the IDEAL note halfway between two C NOTES\nin an IDEAL OCTAVE?  And you can give me the FREQUENCY value if you wish,\nand make the assessment based on one or more tuning systems.  I hope you know\nI agree with you that I am seeking RELATIVE PROPORTION and yet if you wish\nto assign which tuning system you mean it in, and give me also those FREQUENCY\nVALUES, that is fine by me.\n\nThanks in advance,\nmeant kindly,\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

The \n&gt; minor keys use these as well, but in lesser numbers generally..\n&gt; \n&gt; Both the JI and JT scales will play in the 12 major keys, 12 \nseptimal minor \n&gt; keys, and 12 tertian (relative) minor keys.\n\nthanks pauline!\n\n\n"

No?\n\nwhere do you make that jump?\n\n&gt; &gt; and anyway, my objection (not long ago) was mainly intended to\n&gt; &gt; point out that beating is a function of our limited hearing\n&gt; &gt; resolution -- two notes 1 Hz apart might be resolved as separate\n&gt; &gt; pitches, without any perception of beating, by an organism from\n&gt; &gt; another planet (probably a large, slow-moving being).\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh.\n\nwaves are a tricky subject until you&#39;ve gone through fourier&#39;s \ntheorem in depth. quantum mechanics is a great route, particularly \nthe proof that the gaussian probability profile maximizes the \nuncertainty (it gets you that &quot;equals sign&quot; in the heisenberg \nprinciple). the classical case is exactly analogous, of course . . .\n\n\n"

In the 5-limit \ncase, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the commas would now be represented by points, and the ets by \nlines.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i would like very much to look at this dual graph, please give me \n&gt; &gt; some information on how to create it, view it, etc. i&#39;d \nespecially \n&gt; &gt; like it if it could have triangular symmetry like my latest &quot;it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; getting better all the time&quot; ET graph. thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have a point [x, y, z] in homogenous coordinates, the \nequation of a line passing through it will be\n&gt; \n&gt; Ax + By + Cz = 0\n&gt; \n&gt; You can now represent the line as a point [A, B, C] in the dual \nplane, where now [x, y, z] becomes a line.\n\ni was hoping for something better, but i think i may see the answer \nalready -- for each linear temperament, i simply plot the *unison \nvector*, right? let&#39;s see . . . 12-equal banishes [-4,1], [0,3], \n[4,2], [8,1] . . . well the last three do lie on a straight line, \nbut . . . then there&#39;s the negatives of all of these . . . is it \nunavoidable that we&#39;ll have considerably more than one line for each \nET? in the ETs-as-points graph, i cut down on the number by \ninsisisting that at least one of the just consonances be represented \nby its best approximation . . . can i do something similar here?\n\n\n"

I was actually thinking if Canasta wasn&#39;t quite good enough, the same 31 notes tuned to hemiwuerschmidt (a very good 7-limit temperament despite the fact that little attention has been paid to it) might be the ticket. However, it has the same problem that Blackjack or the orwell 22 note MOS or 26 note 2MOS would have; not enough circle of fifths.\n\nOf course if she really wants to play meantone, 19 tones tuned to meantone is a painfully obvious suggestion.\n\n&gt; Have you no decent scales in the artist&#39;s size? \n\nHow much tuning leeway do we get? Besides meantone, the other obvious choice is schismic, which has a 24 note 2MOS to bring a smile to the face of Helmholtz. In its 53-et incarnation, it is\n\n[3,1,3,1,4,1,3,1,3,1,4,1,3,1,3,1,4,1,3,1,4,1,3,1,4,1]\n\nHelmholtz&#39;s reasons for thinking this is a good way to adapt common practice music still apply.\n\nOn the other hand, Canasta allows for five consecutive fifths, excellent if we plan on adapting diatonic music to this scale.\n\n You must know more\n&gt; about Pauline&#39;s intended musical approach than I to make so brazen\n&gt; a suggestion...\n\nNaah; I raise the flag to see if she salutes; that way I might learn what she really wants.\n\n\n"

IE is a browser, not an image editing or viewing program. It is entirely possible that the image viewer in IE ignores some elements of a file that graphics programs show up as a flaw; all current browsers take liberties with the many elements of web presentation, causing much hair to be pulled by designers. \n\nIf at any point these graphics files will be needed for print, you simply *owe* it to yourself to make sure the file is OK. I would suggest having on hand either a low-cost or even no-cost image editing program to make sure you are preparing clean files, and that the results will be good for whoever you send it to.\n\nSince this is completely OT, write me off-list if you want suggestions on these kind of programs; I&#39;ve recently helped out George Secor in a similar area...\n\nCheers,\nJon\n\n\n"

M.\n\nJudith Conrad, keyboard artist\n\nPlaying a five-octave fretted clavichord after one built by Manoel do Carmo of Oporto, Portugal 1796 which is now in the Lisbon Conservatory Collection. Built 2001 by Owen Daly of Salem, Oregon; pairwise fretted in the Iberian Manner.\n\n\n            By nature it is given to me, Music of strings\n                         To love full well;\n          Its soft and gentle sound sets free the greatest\n                       Joy my heart can tell;\n                 And so all praise to thee, my ward,\n                  Thou sweet and gentle clavichord.\n                                       (Christian Weise, 1684)\n\nJudith writes: &quot;This coming weekend I will be outside San Diego, in Poway California where the San Diego Harpsichord Society is having a clavichord exposition Saturday and Sunday, with maybe 10 instruments on display for people to try from 11 to 2 and me giving an informal concert on one of them at 2:00 each day. \n\nI&#39;ll be playing on a copy of a late Portuguese instrument in 6th comma meantone, I know at least one of the instruments on display will be in classic quarter-comma meantone, and the others will mainly be in one non-equal circulating temperament or another, at least if I am who is doing the tuning. The concerts seat a maximum of 20 and I think they are theoretically sold out, &#39;especially Saturday&#39;, I am told, but chances are I could squeeze a serious microtonalist in. &quot;There&#39;s always room for one more at a round table!&quot;, I proved by mathematical induction in some silly high school new math course.

It would help me more if you\n&gt; &gt; would give me the NAME of the IDEAL note halfway between two C \nNOTES\n&gt; &gt; in an IDEAL OCTAVE?\n&gt; \n&gt; it depends on what you mean by halfway. if you mean halfway in \n&gt; frequency, it&#39;s G. if you mean halfway in wavelength or period, \nit&#39;s \n&gt; F. if you mean halfway in terms of how we hear pitch-height, or \n&gt; geometrically, it&#39;s the equal-tempered F#/Gb.\n&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n&gt; Again: thank you very very much, this time as you have ABSOLUTELY\n&gt; answered my quest, and my question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone off-list wrote me that\n&gt; my question resulted into two separate SCALES: one harmonic [I \nassume\n&gt; the C Scale] and the other subharmonic [I assume the F, or F#/Gb.]  \n&gt; Is my assumption correct?\n\ni have no idea what you mean.\n \n&gt; And from your point of view, as a musicologist,\n&gt; would such harmonic/subharmonic fit all THREE of your answers?  Or\n&gt; only one, or two of them?  And which one or two, if not all three?\n&gt; In other words, does HARMONIC/SUBHARMONIC in music theory fit\n&gt; halfway in frequency, or G?  Or halfway in wavelength or period,\n&gt; or F?  Or halfway in pitch-height, or geometrically, the equal-\ntempered\n&gt; F#/Gb?\n\nHARMONIC fits halfway in frequency, so a root C-c octave would \nacquire a G. SUBHARMONIC fits halfway in wavelength and period, so \na &quot;root&quot; (or common overtone) C-c octave would acquire an F.\n\n&gt; [by the way: I mean the AVERAGE physical distance between them or \nthe MEAN,\n&gt; mathematically: NOT the period, and NOT the pitch-height]\n\nhow do you measure the physical distance between musical pitches?\n\n&gt; [by the way: you are stating that in music theory frequency does \nNOT equate\n&gt; with wavelength, agreed?\n\nright, frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength.\n\n&gt; And, also, you are stating that wavelength is\n&gt; equal to period, again in music theory, agreed?] \n\nwavelength is *proportional* to period.\n\n&gt; Daniel Wolf was correct, from my assessment[if I am to understand \nwhat\n&gt; he said]: that only harmonic/proportions\n&gt; can fit the relationships between mean planetary distances\n&gt; and musical notes\n&gt; if a comparison is to be made,\n\ni don&#39;t think he said that . . .\n\n&gt; and I wonder if you see the words\n&gt; PROPORTIONS\n&gt; and HARMONIC/SUBHARMONIC so related?\n\nthey are related. in the old days, before the physical harmonic \nseries was known (a natural phenomenon in which any tone tends to be \naccompanied by tones with integer multiples of its FREQUENCY), string \nlengths on monochords were used to compare pitches, and many \ntheorists demanded simple proportions in those string lengths. string \nlength is approximately inversely proportional to frequency. if these \nstring-length proportions were ARITHMETIC (that is, in proportions \nbelonging to the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . .), the result was what is \ntoday known as SUBHARMONIC. if these proportions were HARMONIC (that \nis, in proportions belonging to the series 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \n1/5 . . .), the result was what is today still known as HARMONIC \n(though typically expressed today as a set of ARITHMETIC proportions \nin FREQUENCY).\n\n\n"

This implies that up to sign, a point is \n&gt; represented by [a,b,c] where a, b, and c are relatively prime \nintegers.\n&gt; \n&gt; This means that 4:5:6 and 8:10:12 are the same point; reducing \n&gt; 8:10:12 by the gcd gives us 4:5:6.\n\nthen you&#39;ve got it! both graphs show this same structure. this \nstructure has baffled me for almost a decade. i learned many of the \nwonderful properties of the farey series in one dimension, and \nwondered if there were any analogous properties in this two-\ndimensional structure. no one in the yale math faculty seemed to have \na clue. we&#39;ve explored these questions mainly on harmonic_entropy, so \nif you have any responses, please post them there.\n\n&gt; &gt; i was hoping for something better, but i think i may see the \nanswer \n&gt; &gt; already -- for each linear temperament, i simply plot the *unison \n&gt; &gt; vector*, right? let&#39;s see . . . 12-equal banishes [-4,1], [0,3], \n&gt; &gt; [4,2], [8,1] . . . well the last three do lie on a straight line, \n&gt; &gt; but . . . then there&#39;s the negatives of all of these . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; Those are affine coordinates; you can projectivize them to\n&gt; [-4,1,1], [0,3,1], etc.\n\nwhat does this mean? and how does this address their non-\ncollinearity? please reply to the rest of this on tuning-math, to \nspare the usual poor souls . . .\n\n&gt; But remember, [-4,1,1] and [4,-1,-1] are the same point!\n\nin what kind of coordinate system?\n\n&gt; More natural would be to take [-4,4,-1], [-7,0,3] etc. as points on \n&gt;a projective plane, and [12,19,28] as the line through them.\n\nyou lost me.\n\n&gt; is it \n&gt; &gt; unavoidable that we&#39;ll have considerably more than one line for \neach \n&gt; &gt; ET? \n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s one line for each val;\n\nthat&#39;s exactly what i want. now i hope you can show me what it looks \nlike.\n\n\n"

Due to \nthe complex mathematical interactions on air, traditional instruments \nhave a great sound quality, but obviously it&#39;s a limitation that \ntheir natural harmonics can&#39;t be altered so easily.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nHi George,\n\n&gt;&gt; But maybe this could be explained by the &#39;tolerance margin&#39; that\n&gt;&gt; one can bu=\n&gt;&gt; ild up over time. To myself, Just intervals grate - not 12- eT.\n&gt;&gt; Also, the oth=\n&gt;&gt; er possiblity could be thanks to point C in my previous reply.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting story btw.\n\n&gt;Since we were trying to convince you that 12-ET is not &quot;best&quot;, it is\n&gt;only necessary to establish that there is something &quot;better&quot;; whether\n&gt;this might be JI or another temperament is secondary. Since you have\n&gt;an objection to JI, I was trying to direct your attention to meantone\n&gt;temperament or 31-ET (its virtual equivalent), which I don&#39;t think\n&gt;anyone has ever described as harsh or grating (as long as you avoid\n&gt;the wolf).\n&gt;\n&gt;The point that I was attempting to make is that, while I was very\n&gt;shocked when I again used 12-ET after several weeks of playing\n&gt;exclusively in meantone, I had a very delightful experience when I\n&gt;first played in meantone temperament after years of playing\n&gt;exclusively in 12-ET. Surely this must say that something other than\n&gt;a &quot;tolerance margin&quot; would be the primary consideration here.\n\nFair enough. Like you say, &#39;Tolerance&#39; would seem to have little or \nnothing to do with it. The only other possiblities then, might be \nsomething to do with some kind of timbre phenomenon (possibly \nspecific to your keyboard) - or maybe the fact that your ears \nsimply &#39;prefer&#39; mean-toned temperament. Also, if the overtone \nharmonics of the instrument timbre was (unavoidably) strongly tuned \ntowards JI, then this could make them clash with the fundamental \ntones or with each other.\n\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I&#39;m mistaken, but I think I recall someone in this group\n&gt;&gt; saying how for /melodic/ purposes, 12-eT is perfect, whilst\n&gt;&gt; harmonically it isn&#39;t perfect (well, he got one of those \nright ;)...\n\n&gt;There is considerable evidence to suggest that raising the leading\n&gt;tone tends to improve the effect of its resolution to the tonic, both\n&gt;melodically *and* harmonically(!). (I wrote an article which was\n&gt;accepted for publication in the next issue of Xenharmonikon in which\n&gt;I elaborate on the effectiveness of a harmonically dissonant leading\n&gt;tone.)\n\nInteresting.\n\n&gt;I was thinking of an experiment in which you were to *listen* to what\n&gt;you were *playing* so that you could try out as many different things\n&gt;as possible in the new tuning. (The problem with today&#39;s digital\n&gt;electronic instruments is that you have to have one that allows you\n&gt;to retune the notes individually.) But if you&#39;re only going to\n&gt;listen to something and not do the actual playing, then try to listen\n\nIt wouldn&#39;t be too easy to retune my keyboard (if at all possible), \nbut I would assume it&#39;s better to concentrate just by listening - \nrather than playing aswell.\n\n&gt;to a number of things in the same tuning (I suggested meantone\n&gt;temperament) for a number of times over a period of a couple of weeks\n&gt;before you go back and listen to the *same thing(s)* (in the same\n&gt;timbres) in 12-ET.\n\nI have done exactly this =) See below for details.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHi wallyesterpaulrus,\n\n&gt;&gt; In the mean time, do you know of a comparison anywhere on the web\n&gt;&gt; which demonstrates a good (say... classical) tune with examples of\n&gt;&gt; 12-eT vs Just tuning? I should imagine the web is filled with\n&gt;&gt; such comparisons - all waiting to prove me wrong! ;D\n\n&gt;it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;ll always prefer the 12-equal versions, because\n&gt;your brain has been &quot;tuned&quot;, you might say, to the 12-equal pitches.\n\nI should hope that&#39;s because they are /best/ tuned that way ;)\n\n&gt;but here goes anyway. this is adaptive tuning, not just, but it tries\n&gt;to make the chords as just as possible within themselves. spend a lot\n&gt;of time with these before commenting:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/d/jdelaub/jstudio.htm\n\nAs I write this letter, I&#39;m listening to the examples presented on \nthe page. In fact I&#39;ve been been doing this for the past couple of \nweeks - with as minimal &#39;exposure&#39; to 12-eT as possible (quite hard \nin this day and age one might find ;)\n\nAs expected, I found it off-tune at first, but I&#39;ll see if I can \nreally get to prefer it. I somehow still suspect that I won&#39;t, but \nI&#39;m going to keep an open mind about this - since obviously many seem \nto think otherwise. I&#39;ll be posting the results here soon.\n\n&gt;and yes, wonderful things, such as the hammond organ, have been\n&gt;acheived by simply retuning the overtones to 12-equal. even 11- equal\n&gt;and 13-equal, which are extremely far from just intonation, have been\n&gt;made to sound &quot;smooth&quot;, by Bill Sethares and Jacky Ligon, among\n&gt;others -- by tuning the overtones, as well as fundamentals, to the\n&gt;equal tuning in question.\n\nIf this is true, then /not/ tuning the overtones to 12-equal is what \nI really think half (or possibly all) the problem is - with the claim \nthat 12-eT isn&#39;t perfect.\nAbout 11 and 13 equal.... ermm - I&#39;ll leave that argument for another \nday... ;D\n\n&gt;on the other hand, as a musical being i *know* that all sorts of\n&gt;weird-ass scales can come to sound &quot;perfect&quot;, in the right musical\n&gt;contexts, and from that point of view the idea of one &quot;perfect&quot;\n&gt;musical scale is both absurd and very sad from the point of view of\n&gt;diminishing musical richness.\n\nNot necessarily - music is based on &#39;limits&#39; all the time.\nThere are so many possibilities in 12-eT unexplored. I would say \nmusic so far has really only begun to scratch the surface, as even in \nthe best classical symphonies (for example), there are subtle \nchord &#39;mistakes&#39; and continuations in the melody/arrangement that \ncould be improved further.\nTaking this to the extreme, theoretically, the best music would be \ntailored right down to the wave - and the individual 0.001 \nsecond &#39;nuggets&#39; that ultimately make all music up.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n \nHi Francois,\n\n&gt;I took a few measurements of final major chords of professional a\n&gt;capella ensemble, (renaissance music, so to be honest, there may be\n&gt;a bias in the style of the performers). The major third is definitely\n&gt;around 385 cents more or less a few cents (the accuracy limit of my\n&gt;measures), and not around let say 375 or 415.\n\nFair enough. For an accurate and objective measurement, I take it \nthere wasn&#39;t much vibrato in their voices at the time?\n\n&gt;&gt;B: Also, it could&#39;ve been that maybe the singer was (mistakingly)\n&gt;&gt;/aiming/ for chords which didn&#39;t beat rather than for what actually \nsounded\n&gt;&gt;best.\n&gt;\n&gt;What singers aim to, isn&#39;t what sound the best (to them at least)?\n&gt;Furthermore,\n&gt;I initially tought that the search of beatless sound was the key to a\n&gt;capella JI.\n&gt;Then I realised that for signing voices, the higher harmonics are\n&gt;relatively\n&gt;blunt (compared to fixed tuning instruments) for harmonics higher\n&gt;than, let say\n&gt;third or fourth. This is probably due to vibrato (even the slightest\n&gt;one) and/or\n&gt;the softness of vocal tract tissues. Whatever is the reason, this\n&gt;makes the beating of voices very difficult to detect directly and\n&gt;unlikely to be the primary clue to JI or not JI.\n\nInteresting, but as faint as a singers&#39; harmonic overtones are, I \nwould&#39;ve thought many (including the singers) could tell if their \nharmonic overtones are in &#39;tune&#39; with each other - even if on a \nsubconscious level.\nI would love to hear human voices sing in harmony, but with the \ntones /and/ overtones tuned exactly to 12-equal :) This would then \navoid the &#39;roughness&#39; that you mentioned is sometimes &#39;preferable&#39; in \ncertain kinds of music.\n\n&gt;&gt;C: Thirdly, as I&#39;ve said in reply to Prophecyspirit, they might be\n&gt;&gt;hitting\n&gt;&gt;this beatless pitch to be in harmony with the (imo) faulty harmonic\n&gt;&gt;overtones that certain instruments produce - rather than in harmony\n&gt;&gt;with the fundamental pitch. This could certainly be plausible.\n\n&gt;Attraction to JI third exists for a capella singing and probably for\n&gt;any instrument capable of pitch adaptation. Further, even the most\n&gt;reputedly inharmonic instrument, the piano, is not THAT inharmonic in\n&gt;the mid range: not enough (IMHO) to make account of the &quot;missing&quot;\n&gt;15 cents of song thirds.\n\nBut possibly enough for the brain to (maybe subconsciously) recognise \na certain &#39;off-tune&#39; sound when the sub-harmonics &#39;clash&#39; against the \nfundamentals/each other (&#39;roughness&#39;)...?\n\n&gt;&gt;D: Due to the acoustic properties of both the human voice and\n&gt;&gt;instrument in question, maybe there&#39;s a quasi-mathematical &#39;sound\n&gt;&gt;effect&#39; (like some kind of subtle &#39;wowowow&#39;) that enhances the\n&gt;&gt;interval if sung in Just (1.25). This though is more of an\n&gt;&gt;side-effect, and I guess this &#39;sound effect&#39; could be mathematically\n&gt;&gt;synthesized and added to the 1.259 interval too if necessary -\n&gt;&gt;then you would have the best of both worlds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;E: Finally, perhaps the singers involved didn&#39;t quite hit the exact\n&gt;&gt;pitch t=\n&gt;&gt;hat they should have done anyway - especially if they were &#39;trained&#39;\n&gt;&gt;to hit =\n&gt;&gt;1.25 - or even &#39;not trained enough&#39; to hit 1.259\n\n&gt;Amateur singers I know are not trained to sign this kind or this \nother\n&gt;kind of third. Nearly none of them are even aware that there is some\n&gt;other interval than those found\n&gt;on the piano. They usually rehearse with a piano, but just thirds pop\n&gt;out naturally\n&gt;when in proper condition (a capella, decent room accoustic, long\n&gt;triadic chords)\n&gt;\n&gt;What I have observed (measured in fact, I do not have such good ear)\n&gt;for\n&gt;a capella ensemble is that the initial value of thirds is often\n&gt;near ET third, but given some time (up to few seconds depending of \nthe\n&gt;skill of the signers) for the chord to settle, the third shrinks \ntoward 385 cents.\n&gt;\n&gt;That suggest that the mental image of the chord, before utterance, is\n&gt;ET (due IMHO to cultural pervasiveness of ET), then, performers \nsettle\n&gt;to more &quot;natural&quot; interval.\n\nAs well as the previous &quot;overtones clashing with fundamentals&quot; \nor &quot;subtle quasi-mathematical &#39;wowowow&#39;&quot; syndromes, this could be \nexplained by something else; Singing in Just intonation might be \neasier for the &#39;singing&#39; brain to cope with. However, to the final \near, 12-eT might ultimately sound better.\n\nCheers,\nDaniel (soundburst@lycos.com)\n\nhttp://www.skytopia.com/project/rating.html\nhttp://www.skytopia.com/soundburst/soundburst.html\n\n\n"

I should imagine the web is filled with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; such comparisons - all waiting to prove me wrong! ;D\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;ll always prefer the 12-equal versions, \nbecause\n&gt; &gt;your brain has been &quot;tuned&quot;, you might say, to the 12-equal \npitches.\n&gt; \n&gt; I should hope that&#39;s because they are /best/ tuned that way ;)\n\nthat would be kind of insulting and/or conceited to anyone that \ndoesn&#39;t inhabit the sphere of modern Western musical culture, \nwouldn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;and yes, wonderful things, such as the hammond organ, have been\n&gt; &gt;acheived by simply retuning the overtones to 12-equal. even 11- \nequal\n&gt; &gt;and 13-equal, which are extremely far from just intonation, have \nbeen\n&gt; &gt;made to sound &quot;smooth&quot;, by Bill Sethares and Jacky Ligon, among\n&gt; &gt;others -- by tuning the overtones, as well as fundamentals, to the\n&gt; &gt;equal tuning in question.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this is true, then /not/ tuning the overtones to 12-equal is \nwhat \n&gt; I really think half (or possibly all) the problem is - with the \nclaim \n&gt; that 12-eT isn&#39;t perfect.\n&gt; About 11 and 13 equal.... ermm - I&#39;ll leave that argument for \nanother \n&gt; day... ;D\n\nwell, it really part of the same argument. if just tuning has nothing \nto do with it, but eliminating clashing partials does have something \nto do with it, then you&#39;d have no basis for preferring a 12-equal \ntuning (of fundamentals _and_ overtones) to an 11-equal or 13-equal \ntuning (again, of fundamentals _and_ overtones). \n\n&gt; &gt;on the other hand, as a musical being i *know* that all sorts of\n&gt; &gt;weird-ass scales can come to sound &quot;perfect&quot;, in the right musical\n&gt; &gt;contexts, and from that point of view the idea of one &quot;perfect&quot;\n&gt; &gt;musical scale is both absurd and very sad from the point of view of\n&gt; &gt;diminishing musical richness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not necessarily - music is based on &#39;limits&#39; all the time.\n&gt; There are so many possibilities in 12-eT unexplored.\n\neven more in other tunings!\n\n&gt; I would say \n&gt; music so far has really only begun to scratch the surface, as even \nin \n&gt; the best classical symphonies (for example), there are subtle \n&gt; chord &#39;mistakes&#39; and continuations in the melody/arrangement that \n&gt; could be improved further.\n&gt; Taking this to the extreme, theoretically, the best music would be \n&gt; tailored right down to the wave - and the individual 0.001 \n&gt; second &#39;nuggets&#39; that ultimately make all music up.\n\nright -- and clearly very few pieces created in such a way would \nconform to a 12-equal grid!\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;B: Also, it could&#39;ve been that maybe the singer was (mistakingly)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;/aiming/ for chords which didn&#39;t beat rather than for what \nactually \n&gt; sounded\n&gt; &gt;&gt;best.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What singers aim to, isn&#39;t what sound the best (to them at least)?\n&gt; &gt;Furthermore,\n&gt; &gt;I initially tought that the search of beatless sound was the key \nto a\n&gt; &gt;capella JI.\n&gt; &gt;Then I realised that for signing voices, the higher harmonics are\n&gt; &gt;relatively\n&gt; &gt;blunt (compared to fixed tuning instruments) for harmonics higher\n&gt; &gt;than, let say\n&gt; &gt;third or fourth. This is probably due to vibrato (even the \nslightest\n&gt; &gt;one) and/or\n&gt; &gt;the softness of vocal tract tissues. Whatever is the reason, this\n&gt; &gt;makes the beating of voices very difficult to detect directly and\n&gt; &gt;unlikely to be the primary clue to JI or not JI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting, but as faint as a singers&#39; harmonic overtones are, I \n&gt; would&#39;ve thought many (including the singers) could tell if their \n&gt; harmonic overtones are in &#39;tune&#39; with each other - even if on a \n&gt; subconscious level.\n\nmaybe, but daniel, you need to look beyond beating and study up on \n*combinational tones*. if you have helmholtz&#39;s book, you can read \nsome about them there. otherwise, do some web searches. please?\n\n&gt; I would love to hear human voices sing in harmony, but with the \n&gt; tones /and/ overtones tuned exactly to 12-equal :)\n\nof course (i know you were joking but i&#39;ll go on) that&#39;s impossible, \nbecause any physical musical instrument that produces a periodic \nvibration (including the human voice, bowed strings, reeds, and brass \ninstruments, when producing a clear tone) has, by virtue of fourier&#39;s \ntheorem, a perfectly harmonic overtone spectrum.\n&gt; \n&gt; But possibly enough for the brain to (maybe subconsciously) \nrecognise \n&gt; a certain &#39;off-tune&#39; sound when the sub-harmonics &#39;clash&#39; against \nthe \n&gt; fundamentals/each other (&#39;roughness&#39;)...?\n\nwhat &quot;sub-harmonics&quot; are you speaking of? virtual pitches?\n\n&gt; As well as the previous &quot;overtones clashing with fundamentals&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;subtle quasi-mathematical &#39;wowowow&#39;&quot; syndromes, this could be \n&gt; explained by something else; Singing in Just intonation might be \n&gt; easier for the &#39;singing&#39; brain to cope with. However, to the final \n&gt; ear, 12-eT might ultimately sound better.\n\nwhat if no one is listening but the singers? :)\n\n\n"

Or\n&gt; only one, or two of them? And which one or two, if not all three?\n&gt; In other words, does HARMONIC/SUBHARMONIC in music theory fit\n&gt; halfway in frequency, or G? Or halfway in wavelength or period,\n&gt; or F? Or halfway in pitch-height, or geometrically, the equal-\ntempered\n&gt; F#/Gb?\n\nHARMONIC fits halfway in frequency, so a root C-c octave would \nacquire a G. SUBHARMONIC fits halfway in wavelength and period, so \na &quot;root&quot; (or common overtone) C-c octave would acquire an F.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nmy remarks: the above is where I think the confusion has arisen\nby astrophysicists who deal with planetary distances and periods\nand have tried to make themselves understood to musicologists.\nI hope I can get us on the same page of understanding.  I want to\nthank you for your kindness is trying to make me understand this.\nI hope you would read through my remarks, which is really exploratory,\nsince I am not sure what astrophysicists NEED from musicologists\nto make sense of this COMPARISON of planetary DISTANCES to \nmusical HARMONY of the spheres. \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n&gt; [by the way: you are stating that in music theory frequency does \nNOT equate\n&gt; with wavelength, agreed?\n\nright, frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nmy remarks, inverse proportion takes a formula: what is it?\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n&gt; And, also, you are stating that wavelength is\n&gt; equal to period, again in music theory, agreed?] \n\nwavelength is *proportional* to period.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nmy remarks: I think why astrophysicists [my catch-all word for\ncycle scientists, astronomers, et al., who have tried to come to\ngrips with the MATH of the solar-planetary system, and its\nso-called Titius-BODE&#39;S LAW, which I claim to have simplified\nas Arnold&#39;s Law, mainly OF PROPORTIONS] have been unable to make\nthe leap to MUSIC is that they have been confused by these very\npoints we are dealing with.  So please bear with me, if you are\nwilling.  \n\nI agree wavelength is PROPORTIONAL to period.  My papers, which\nhopefully will be put online by a member of TUNING, covers my\ntake on that.  The trouble is that the distances between the planets\nand the Sun were expressed in fractions of a.u., the distance from\nthe Sun to the Earth.  Technically, it is a Radian of a Circle.\nThe Perimeter of the Circle that the Earth travels round the Sun\nis Equal to 2 Pi Radians.  That 2 in the mix confused those who\nwould try to relate all this to MUSIC which in octaval terms\nhas a 2X factor built into its system, as well.  Thus PERIOD in\nplanetary terms gets confused with DISTANCE between planets,\nwhereas they are different terms, inasmuch as PERIOD is a\nPERIMETER descriptive term and DISTANCE is either a RADIAN term\nor a DIAMETER term.  In my heart of hearts I believe the same is\ntrue in MUSIC but I leave that for MATH minds in music to deal with.\nThe point is: that in order for planetary DISTANCES or PERIODS to\nbe related to MUSICAL terms, we must be assured which terms we are\nusing.  I hope I am being understood.  I know to some this is really\nabstruse stuff, but I hope those who don&#39;t care will hit the D button,\nand those that do will help out.  I know you CARE and apparently\ncan relate.  And maybe we can get to a common ground of understanding.  \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n&gt; and I wonder if you see the words\n&gt; PROPORTIONS\n&gt; and HARMONIC/SUBHARMONIC so related?\n\nthey are related. in the old days, before the physical harmonic \nseries was known (a natural phenomenon in which any tone tends to be \naccompanied by tones with integer multiples of its FREQUENCY), string \nlengths on monochords were used to compare pitches, and many \ntheorists demanded simple proportions in those string lengths. string \nlength is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nmy remarks: I think this is where non-musicians in planetary science\nhave stumbled in attempts to relate the harmonics of the spheres\nwith planetary distances as I said above.  Let us move on to the\nNEW musicology of ALTERNATE TUNING knowledge which seems to have\nadvanced knowledge since to good ole days.  I am guessing that what\nGuy Murchie wrote in MUSIC OF THE SPHERES has been advanced enough\nthat a NEW take on these matters would improve the understanding.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n if these \nstring-length proportions were ARITHMETIC (that is, in proportions \nbelonging to the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . .), the result was what is \ntoday known as SUBHARMONIC. \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nmy remarks: I do not think that HARMONIC and SUBHARMONIC as you are\nusing them are used the same way by cycle-scientists, astrophysicists,\nand the like.  Thus, I hope you would make me understand what you mean,\nas you seem to make absolute sense to me.  But so many musicologists use\nthese two terms so differently.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nif these proportions were HARMONIC (that \nis, in proportions belonging to the series 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \n1/5 . . .), the result was what is today still known as HARMONIC \n(though typically expressed today as a set of ARITHMETIC proportions \nin FREQUENCY).\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nmy remarks: the fact that &quot;today&quot; it is &quot;still known as HARMONIC&quot;\nbut is &quot;typically expressed...as a set of ARITHMETIC proportions in\nFREQUENCY&quot; is what I think confuses the astrophysicsts [my umbrella-word\nmeaning, of course] who wish to talk to musicologists.  For some reason,\nI always lumped words like frequency, harmonic and the like into one\nnebulous basket.  And so do many outside the realm of music.  I know\nthat is NOT proper, inasmuch as you are using MATH as a basis of transference\nbetween TERMS and I must understand what you mean.  So, I hope you bear\nwith me.  In the IDEAL state of the solar-planetary system, there is\nan ARITHMETIC series of NUMBERS which represents the planetary RADIANS:\nSun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2, Earth 3, Mars 4, Ceres 8, Jupiter 15,\nSaturn 30, Uranus 60, Neptune 90, and Pluto 120.\n\nIf we express the same\nin DIAMETERS,\nobviously the ARITHMETIC series of NUMBERS doubles.\n\nIf we express the\nsame in PERIMETERS,\nobviously the ARITHMETIC series of NUMBERS is only\nincreased PORPORTIONALLY by the value of PI: 3.14+....\n\nThus, I ask\nof you: Is this an ARITHMETIC series as I suggest?  If so, is IT a\nHARMONIC series?  Or SUBHARMONIC?  And what does IT mean in music\nterms?  \n\nI grant that two items, Earth and Neptune, are HALFWAY\nbetween their respective NUMBERS.  And that IS in terms of ARITHMETICS.\n\nSo, I am understanding from your statements, that the PRIMARY series of\nARITHMETIC NUMBERS is OCTAVAL.  And I am understanding that the OTHER \ntwo ARITHMETIC NUMBERS is halfway between them.  We are really talking\nabout DISTANCES between these NUMBERS, even if we EXPAND the numbers by\n2X and again by PI at 3.14+....  Does this help you in telling me which\nNOTE I am seeking?  \n\nCan I make the MAGICAL leap to MUSIC with your help?  Please understand,\nthat because there is a different DEFINITION from one group of scientists\n[astrophysicists] to the other [musicologists], there appears to me to\nbe confusion.  And I am not imply you or I or either group is confused.\nOn the contrary, I think we need to find the common language, the precise\nTERMS and the precise DEFINITIONS.  I hope I haven&#39;t asked for too much?\n \n\nThanks in advance,\nmeant kindly,\n\nBill Arnold\nbillarnoldfla@yahoo.com\nhttp://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm\nIndependent Scholar\nIndependent Scholar, Modern Language Association\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!

And now why is that so funny?\n\nWell, it contradicts practically *every* other statement in the book, \nwhere he states that no consensus is being established, and there is \nno real reason to expect that such is *going* to happen.\n\nI&#39;m not going to type them all up... alright, I&#39;ll type *one* up, \nfrom page 3, &quot;Prelude&quot;:\n\n&quot;Agreement on a standardized system of microtonal notation thus \nbecomes an imperative for all composers working with fractional \npitches.  yet the prognosis for such a notational utopia is not \nencouraging;  as music editor, composer, and musicologist Rudolf \nRasch lamented in a letter to this researcher: &quot;Experience up to now \nhas taught me that most composers prefer to stick to their own \nsystems of notation and are not willing to adopt anything proposed by \nsomebody else.&#39;  The present study surely verifies Rasch&#39;s \nconclusion.&quot;\n\nSo, basically, what was Read on when he wrote Chapter IV??  Ecstasy?? \nor something stronger...?\n\nJ. Pehrson\n\n\n\n"

Here&#39;s the quote:\n\n&quot;Interestingly enough, Partch&#39;s system has an early, and unique, \nforerunner:  the French acoustician Joseph Sauveur&#39;s &#39;merides&#39; of \n1701, in which the octave was split into forty-three intervals.  Each \nof the seven diatonic notes and their syllables, ut to si, were \ndivided into six parts, which he termed &quot;merides...&quot;\n\nHe goes on (page 136):\n\n&quot;...so far the 43-tone scale has not won over as many advocates as \nthe scales of nineteen, twenty-four, thirty-one and fifty-three tones \nper octave...&quot;\n\nNow, the previous chapters have been discussing EQUAL temperaments.  \nPartch&#39;s scale is definitely *not* an ET.  So how can he &quot;lump&quot; it in \nwith the ET&#39;s?\n\nMore to the point, is Sauveur&#39;s scale an ET as well??  It doesn&#39;t \nseem as though it is... This is rather unclear...\n\nHelp??\n\nThanks!\n\nJ. Pehrson\n\n\n\n"

They are out and out hostile. They are \ntrying to make me stop. They are trying to demoralize me.&quot;\n\ni think you and i, joseph, can perhaps both sympathize with this \npredicament!\n\n&quot;I think the overall purpose of music is to entertain and \nplease . . . Nothing more, nothing less. It provides high class \nentertainment to a relatively small audience of people who are tuned \ninto it.&quot;\n\nas far as i&#39;m concerned, blackwood has some BIG BALLS to come out and \nsay this. go easley!! NB: see thing about &quot;subtlety&quot; below.\n\n&quot;More likely the 5th Symphony, or the march in the 6th Symphony, or a \npiece like Respighi&#39;s Feste Romani, or a Beethoven 7th. Usually, it&#39;s \na big splashy exciting piece, and they go on from there and work into \nthe subtleties and get into the less bombastic things. They get into \nBrahms and Beethoven and Mozart. And then they find their way into \nchamber music.&quot;\n\npersonally, i was *really* interested in chamber music as a young \nkid, and only later grew to appreciate big splashy exciting pieces.\n\n&quot;EB: It certainly is helpful. But after teaching harmony for 35 \nyears, I can hear the chord progressions. The other night, just for \nfun, I switched on the radio and heard the slow movement of the \nJupiter Symphony of Mozart. I hadn&#39;t thought about the piece for \nawhile, but I found that as I listened to it, I could identify every \nchord as it went by. I could hear the piece go I, V of ii, V of v, V, \nV of iv, perfectly clear knowing what it was. At an earlier time I \nwould&#39;ve been able to figure it out. But as it was, it went by and I \nheard it.&quot;\n\nin this regard too, i think i developed in the opposite order -- i \ncould identify chord progressions before i had much aptitude for \nmelody or even rhythm!\n\n&quot;Now perhaps, having this ability at this point has kind of changed \nmy perspective on atonal music.&quot;\n\ni guess it makes sense that someone like blackwood, who started out \nwith perfect pitch, would have been drawn to atonal music for a time. \nbut what of someone like me, with only *relative* pitch? could it be \nthat the whole serial/atonal premise is even less aesthetically \nrelavant for us &quot;relative&quot; underlings?\n\n&quot;BD: You don&#39;t want to be obvious? \n\nEB: I don&#39;t want to be obvious. I want subtleties to be there. \n\nBD: Do you want to give obvious pleasure? \n\nEB: Yes, I do, but I want there to be subtleties above and beyond \nthat. If it gives obvious pleasure and there are no subtleties, \nyou&#39;ve got a piece like Orff&#39;s &quot;Carmina Burana.&quot; \n\nBD: That one just hits you in the gut. \n\nEB: It hits you in the gut and you listen to it 5 times and that&#39;s \nthe end. \n\nBD: And yet, some people listen to it 500 times. \n\nEB: I remember when I first heard it. I was absolutely swept off my \nfeet. This must have been about 1958. I listened to it immediately \nagain and then listened to it every day for four days and then that \nwas the end of it. Never heard it again. Never wanted to hear it \nagain. \n\nBD: That was 35 years ago. Would you want to hear it again now? \n\nEB: Oh sure. But it lost my attention at that time. There are no \nsubtleties in it. &quot;\n\ni know exactly what he means. in a way, that&#39;s why i like \nimprovisation. there&#39;s no danger of playing exactly the same thing \ntwice. unfortunately, i don&#39;t practice enough, or perhaps have enough \nnatural talent, or am still too young and inexperienced, to really \nhit that transcendent subtlety more than say 15% of the time, but if \ni can simply entertain the other 85% of the time, that&#39;s good enough \nfor me! . . .\n\nmaybe any more on this should go on &quot;metatuning&quot; . . .\n\n\n"

Or SUBHARMONIC?\n\nmusically, it&#39;s neither, since you have distances (in units of \nlegnth) instead of frequencies or periods (in units of inverse time \nor time, respectively -- your series does not pertain to those \nquantities, correct?) -- though you could convert distance to \nwavelength, you would need the speed of sound in the relevant medium. \nsince the medium of empty space \n\n&gt; And what does IT mean in music\n&gt; terms?  \n\nsee above.\n\n&gt; So, I am understanding from your statements, that the PRIMARY \nseries of\n&gt; ARITHMETIC NUMBERS is OCTAVAL.\n\nhmm . . . i don&#39;t think so. the &quot;octaval&quot; series would be 1, 2, 4, \n8 . . . just the powers of 2 . . . if 1 is C, then 2, 4, 8 . . . are \nalso Cs, just in different octave.s\n\n&gt; And I am understanding that the OTHER \n&gt; two ARITHMETIC NUMBERS is halfway between them.  We are really \ntalking\n&gt; about DISTANCES between these NUMBERS, even if we EXPAND the \nnumbers by\n&gt; 2X and again by PI at 3.14+....  Does this help you in telling me \nwhich\n&gt; NOTE I am seeking?  \n\nno, what note *are* you seeking?\n\n\n"

So how can he &quot;lump&quot; \nit \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; with the ET&#39;s?\n&gt; \n&gt; he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. besides, if you *were* to \n&gt; think of partch&#39;s scale as an ET, it would be as 41-tET with two \n&gt; alternates -- not 43-tET!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; More to the point, is Sauveur&#39;s scale an ET as well??\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, and 43-tET is a type of *meantone* tuning -- almost identical \nto \n&gt; 1/5-comma meantone.\n\n***Thanks, Paul!

At the time, I was trying to find a way to\nautomate the\n&gt;&quot;adjusted&quot; versions\n\nRight now I am working on a 19-edo ska song for computer and soprano\ntrombone (adaptation of &quot;Wrong way&quot;, by Sublime) It goes down 50/49\nevery two bars, and back up by 4/3 after 16 bars. (No wave file yet,\njust a draft version of the midi file, without the 4/3 &quot;bridging&quot;.)\n\nThe 2-bar pattern is : \n1/1 major C D E F G A B C\n10/7 (major chords of 10/7 and 49/50) F# Gb B Cb D# Eb F#\n(49/50 major Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb C)\n\ncomma shifts are handled (in scala) by saying :\n0 transpose [80/81]\n\nWhen the whole song is written in terms of just ratios enclosed in\nbrackets, changing the scale becomes easy.\n\nCould a similar approach solve the problem you had with automatically\nadjusting pitch?\n\n7Kami ROUSSEAU\nGo vote for adding microtonal support to the Java Sound API : \nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4705306.html\n\n\n"

Here&#39;s the quote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Interestingly enough, Partch&#39;s system has an early, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unique, forerunner:  the French acoustician Joseph\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sauveur&#39;s &#39;merides&#39; of 1701, in which the octave was split\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into forty-three intervals.  Each of the seven diatonic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; notes and their syllables, ut to si, were divided into six\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parts, which he termed &quot;merides...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He goes on (page 136):\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;...so far the 43-tone scale has not won over as many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advocates as the scales of nineteen, twenty-four,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thirty-one and fifty-three tones per octave...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, the previous chapters have been discussing EQUAL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temperaments.  Partch&#39;s scale is definitely *not* an ET. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So how can he &quot;lump&quot; it in with the ET&#39;s?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. besides, if you\n&gt; &gt; *were* to think of partch&#39;s scale as an ET, it would be as\n&gt; &gt; 41-tET with two alternates -- not 43-tET!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; More to the point, is Sauveur&#39;s scale an ET as well??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; yes, and 43-tET is a type of *meantone* tuning -- almost\n&gt; &gt; identical to 1/5-comma meantone.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***Thanks, Paul!

The two pitches in any octave\n&gt; beat strongly with each other!\n\nYes, and if you say that 12-et is the only true tuning, as some do, it means that the partials of say a &#39;cello\nin a &#39;cello  concerto are out of tune, and the instrument should be rebuilt somehow to have a timbre with 12-et\npartials - surely! Or maybe all the 12-et  recordings we have should be electronically manipulated to have only\n12-et pitches in the ;-).\n\n- the &quot;out of tune&quot; &#39;cello partials such as even the seventh partial can be louder than many of the accompanying\ninstruments in a &#39;cello concerto - but you have to listen pretty carefully to hear them - maybe in sustained\nnotes, because we tend to hear it as a single timbre rather than a multitude of separate instruments.\n\n12-et as a fine tuning, indeed, and a vibrant one. Has a lot of energy in it - wakes one up!\n(Though it may possibly be somewhat of a twentieth century aquired taste, otherwise why didn&#39;t the\nmusicians of Bach&#39;s time go for it when they could have easily retuned their harpsichords to match their\nlutes etc.).\n\nMy little &#39;cello drone midi clip exercise at\nhttp://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes\nmay make a few think? Those notes are at the correct relative volumes\nfor the partials at least as measured on my &#39;cello voice here\non the SB Live S/W synth.\n\nAlso this exercise with the highland bagpipes\nhttp://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes/acoustics/psychodrone.html\nwhich brings them out more clearly. Maybe someone should do that\nwith the &#39;cello too - would be quite striking.\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Besides, Joe, I don&#39;t know if anyone has said this in public, but if it wasn&#39;t for you the whole Sonic Arts thing would be an antique shop and some microtonal memorabilia. With the Dictionary and all the other work you&#39;ve done, it makes it seem like Sonic Arts is an entity.\n\nAnd, I guess, because of you it *is*.\n\nIs Denny G. completely out of the picture these days?

M.\n\nJudith Conrad, keyboard artist\n\nPlaying a five-octave fretted clavichord after one built by Manoel do Carmo \nof Oporto, Portugal 1796 which is now in the Lisbon Conservatory \nCollection. Built 2001 by Owen Daly of Salem, Oregon; pairwise fretted in \nthe Iberian Manner.\n\n\n             By nature it is given to me, Music of strings\n                          To love full well;\n           Its soft and gentle sound sets free the greatest\n                        Joy my heart can tell;\n                  And so all praise to thee, my ward,\n                   Thou sweet and gentle clavichord.\n                                        (Christian Weise, 1684)\n\nJudith writes: &quot;This coming weekend I will be outside San Diego, in Poway \nCalifornia where the San Diego Harpsichord Society is having a clavichord \nexposition Saturday and Sunday, with maybe 10 instruments on display for \npeople to try from 11 to 2 and\nme giving an informal concert on one of them at 2:00 each day.\n\nI&#39;ll be playing on a copy of a late Portuguese instrument in 6th comma \nmeantone, I know at least one of the instruments on display will be in \nclassic quarter-comma meantone, and the others will mainly be in one \nnon-equal circulating temperament or another, at least if I am who is doing \nthe tuning. The concerts seat a maximum of 20 and I think they are \ntheoretically sold out, &#39;especially Saturday&#39;, I am told,\nbut chances are I could squeeze a serious microtonalist in. &quot;There&#39;s always \nroom for one more at a round table!&quot;, I proved by mathematical induction in \nsome silly high school new math course. Remember New Math?&quot;\n\nCheers,\nJon (who unfortunately can&#39;t attend, but knows micro people in SD might \nwant to)\n\n\n"

The just passages \nhave a sound and impact which to my knowledge, you just can&#39;t \nget using 12-eqt.  That being the case, 12-eqt is limited and \ndoesn&#39;t cover the whole of the possibilities for effect of which \nharmony is capable. \n\n    But there are people who very much dislike the sound of music \nin just intonation, and for those people, just intonation, even \nthought it sounds different, doesn&#39;t have much to offer.  But there \nare others of us - over 25% at least - who contrariwise like the \nsound of the just versions better, finding their emotional impact \nto be more pleasing and intense.  Should we be left out? \n\n    There will always be people who initially react strongly against \nsomething which clashes with what they are used to hearing - the fact \nthat it sounds &quot;different&quot; becomes psychologically equivalent to \nsounding &quot;off&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or just &quot;wrong&quot; to them. \n\n    Dave Hill     Borrego Springs, CA\n\n"

Has a lot of energy\n&gt;in it - wakes one up!\n\n    12 ET may wake one up, at first, but there is an inuring effect that \ncomes with it.  Ultimately, it begins to dull the senses at a particularly \norganic level.  Et can desensitize the nervous system in a sadly insidious \nway. \n    When all like intervals are the same tempered size, the ear begins to \naccept the dissonance as the standard harmonic quality, and stops listening \nfor the textural sensations that comes from juxtaposing tempered vs. Just \nintervals.  (We may liken this to weather.  After a few weeks of perfect 70 \ndegree, sunny weather in the South Pacific islands, I began to wish for the \nexcitement of a passing thunderstorm.  Unchanging qualities dull our senses \nin one way or another). \n   So it is with 12 ET.  All thirds are the same and they are all busy, but \nafter a while, that busy-ness becomes less and less stimulative.  We just \nstop paying attention to the physical quality of the interval. Compare this \nto a Kirnberger III and we find that the busy-ness of the A or Eb triad is \nmuch more noticeable after the near purity of the C, G or F.  Indeed, the \nappreciation for either direction is enhanced by there being a contrast with \nthe other.  \n \n\n&gt;(Though it may possibly be somewhat of a twentieth century aquired taste,\n&gt;otherwise why didn&#39;t the musicians of Bach&#39;s time go for it when they could \nhave easily retuned\n&gt;their harpsichords to match their lutes etc.).\n\n    (Half full/ half empty glasses sitting on the brow of my nose)  I posit \nthat ET isn&#39;t an acquired taste so much as it is an entropic result of \nconvenience ( entrophy in the sense of the degradation of the matter and \nenergy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity).  Great \nmusic can be built with it, but it has its costs.      \n     It is very difficult to get an ET by unison matching a keyboard to a \nlute, but I don&#39;t think that is the reason for its rejection in the 18th \ncentury.  The well-tempered tunings are more complex than ET, and they \nprovide a greater degree of expression than those that were homogenious,(such \nas the 1/4C or ET).  The piano music of the Classical era made use of the \ngreater resources available when the keys had their own characters and the \nloss of those characters is, imho, one reason that that music has fallen as \nfar from favor as it has.  \n   So,  I submit that the greatest shortcoming of ET is not that the keys are \nlacking in consonance, but rather, that there is only one harmonic value for \nany given class of intervals, the result of which is that in the listener, \nthe involuntary psycho-physiological-emotive processes are reduced, and that \nmuch of the music&#39;s effect becomes based on intellectual response, rather \nthan the emotional/intellectual reaction that can make music such a magical \nevent.  \n   I dunno,  using ET to construct music is like using bricks to construct \nbuildings.  They can create some major structures, but a brick building will \nnever create the same impression as one built of natural stone.  \nPlaying Bach on ET is similar to building a replica of Notre Dame Cathedral \nout of brick. Something is lost in the process, but only those that have seen \nthe original may notice what is missing.  \nRegards, \nEd Foote \nNashville, Tn.  \n\n"
