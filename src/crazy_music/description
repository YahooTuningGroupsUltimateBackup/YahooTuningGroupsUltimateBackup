Welcome to the Irrational Microtonal Music Workshop!


This group is about making Microtonal Music. Microtonal Music is concerned with issues of pitch in music making, outside of constraints of the standardized western 12 tone equal temperament tuning that pervades the world of music today. Every kind of Microtonal Tuning is welcome: Just Intonation, Non-Just Non-Equal, Non-12 Equal Temperaments, Xenharmonics, Xentonality, Nonoctave Tunings, Ethnic, Found and Invented scales - anything that leads toward the active creation of new works of Microtonal Music. Members work together based on the powerful philosophy of the late Ivor Darreg, that: "There are no bad scales". We gather to share ideas about the creation of Microtonal Music. All persons, employing all means of Microtonal Music production, from acoustic sticks to electronic rocket ships, are on an equal level.

To join, you should either be actively making Microtonal Music, or else you have some serious interest in this activity. There are no leaders here, only people who are interested in sharing their personal experience in the joyous and beautiful act of Microtonal Music creation. Compositional techniques, theoretical ideas which lead to the realization of living, breathing Microtonal Music and open sharing of actual music are the further themes of our group. Members are here to help, and share in our common ground, to achieve the ultimate ends of getting Microtonal Music recorded, and made available to an audience of interested listeners. Join us and come together in an open spirit of sharing of this wonderful pursuit.

Our Motto is "Keeping it Real."
