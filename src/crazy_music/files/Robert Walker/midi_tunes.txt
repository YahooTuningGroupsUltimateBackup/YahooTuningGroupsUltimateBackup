.gif =  scores. Lyric shows the scale that the notes
are to be retuned to. Scale may or may not span an octave for notated
octave of the score, e.g. a pentatonic scale played from consecutive
white keys spans an octave for every 5 "white keys" on the score.

.nwc = NoteWorthy Composer files, to be played through midi relaying
software retuned according to the scale shown in the lyric line.
(I use Fractal Tune Smithy; any midi retuning program can be used).

.ts = Fractal Tune Smithy format, for fractal tunes. May need
most recent beta or beta preview, e.g. to play the custom voices
such as marimba harpsichord.

I've been imagining what it would be like to walk round a street
corner and run into a 17-tet hurdy gurdy player.

It's in the Dominant Pentatonic, Shang: China 
1/1 9/8 5/4 3/2 9/5 2/1 | Dominant Pentatonic, Shang: China 
At the moment I'm exploring the idea of letting the consonances of
a j.i. scale guide ones composition.

Uses Contrabass at ultra high pitch for the dulcimer partials.

I'm exploring the idea of using a somewhat inharmonic timbre to make a simple
(though rather interesting!) j.i. scale sound rather exotic.

Here it is with a normal low pitched ContraBass instead:
